IC 34-13-3-5 Actions against individual members not authorized; judgment against or settlement by governmental entity 
Sec. 5. (a) Civil actions relating to acts taken by a board, a committee, a commission, an authority, or another instrumentality of a governmental entity may be brought only against the board, the committee, the commission, the authority, or the other instrumentality of a governmental entity. A member of a board, a committee, a commission, an authority, or another instrumentality of a governmental entity may not be named as a party in a civil suit that concerns the acts taken by a board, a committee, a commission, an authority, or another instrumentality of a governmental entity where the member was acting within the scope of the member's employment. For the purposes of this subsection, a member of a board, a committee, a commission, an authority, or another instrumentality of a governmental entity is acting within the scope of the member's employment when the member acts as a member of the board, committee, commission, authority, or other instrumentality. 
(b) 
A judgment rendered with respect to or a settlement made by a governmental entity bars an action by the claimant against an employee, including a member of a board, a committee, a commission, an authority, or another instrumentality of a governmental entity, whose conduct gave rise to the claim resulting in that judgment or settlement. A lawsuit alleging that an employee acted within the scope of the employee's employment bars an action by the claimant against the employee personally. However, if the governmental entity answers that the employee acted outside the scope of the employee's employment, the plaintiff may amend the complaint and sue the employee personally. An amendment to the complaint by the plaintiff under this subsection must be filed not later than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the answer was filed and may be filed notwithstanding the fact that the statute of limitations has run. 

(c) 
A lawsuit filed against an employee personally must allege that an act or omission of the employee that causes a loss is: 

(1) 
criminal; 

(2) 
clearly outside the scope of the employee's employment; 

(3) 
malicious; 

(4) 
willful and wanton; or 



(5) 
calculated to benefit the employee personally. The complaint must contain a reasonable factual basis supporting the allegations. 

(d) 
This subsection applies when the governmental entity defends or has received proper legal notice and has the opportunity to defend an employee for losses resulting from the employee's acts or 

omissions. Subject to the provisions of sections 4, 14, 15, and 16 of this chapter, the governmental entity shall pay any judgment of a claim or suit against an employee when the act or omission causing the loss is within the scope of the employee's employment, regardless of whether the employee can or cannot be held personally liable for the loss. 

(e) 
The governmental entity shall provide counsel for and pay all costs and fees incurred by or on behalf of an employee in defense of a claim or suit for a loss occurring because of acts or omissions within the scope of the employee's employment, regardless of whether the employee can or cannot be held personally liable for the loss. 


(f) This chapter shall not be construed as: 
(1) 
a waiver of the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States; 

(2) 
consent by the state of Indiana or its employees to be sued in any federal court; or 

(3) 
consent to be sued in any state court beyond the boundaries of Indiana.

(b) 
The attorney general, by rule adopted under IC 4-22-2, shall prescribe a claim form to be used to file a notice under this section. The claim form must specify:

A claim must be filed within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the alleged loss. 
(b) 
The department of correction shall evaluate each claim filed under subsection (a) and determine the amount due, if any. If the amount due is not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), the department shall approve the claim for payment and recommend to the office of the attorney general payment under subsection (c). The department shall submit all claims in which the amount due exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000), with any recommendation the department considers appropriate, to the office of the attorney general. The attorney general, in acting upon the claim, shall consider recommendations of the department to determine whether to deny the claim or recommend the claim to the governor for approval of payment. 

(c) 
Payment of claims under this section shall be made in the same manner as payment of claims under IC 34-4-16.5-22.

commission created under IC 27-1-29; within one hundred eighty (180) days after the loss occurs.
