IC 36-1-12-3 Public work projects 
Sec. 3. (a) The board may purchase or lease materials in the manner provided in IC 5-22 and perform any public work, by means of its own workforce, without awarding a contract whenever the cost of that public work project is estimated to be less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). Before a board may perform any work under this section by means of its own workforce, the political subdivision or agency must have a group of employees on its staff who are capable of performing the construction, maintenance, and repair applicable to that work. For purposes of this subsection, the cost of a public work project includes: 
(1) 
the actual cost of materials, labor, equipment, and rental; 

(2) 
a reasonable rate for use of trucks and heavy equipment owned; and 

(3) 
all other expenses incidental to the performance of the project. 


(b) This subsection applies only to a municipality or a county. The workforce of a municipality or county may perform a public work described in subsection (a) only if: 
(1) 
the workforce, through demonstrated skills, training, or expertise, is capable of performing the public work; and 

(2) 
for a public work project under subsection (a) whose cost is estimated to be more than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), the board: 

(A) 
publishes a notice under IC 5-3-1 that: 

(i) 
describes the public work that the board intends to perform with its own workforce; and 

(ii) 
sets forth the projected cost of each component of the public work as described in subsection (a); and 



(B) 
determines at a public meeting that it is in the public interest to perform the public work with the board's own workforce. 




A public work project performed by a board's own workforce must be inspected and accepted as complete in the same manner as a public work project performed under a contract awarded after receiving bids. 
(c) 
When the project involves the rental of equipment with an operator furnished by the owner, or the installation or application of materials by the supplier of the materials, the project is considered to be a public work project and subject to this chapter. However, an annual contract may be awarded for equipment rental and materials to be installed or applied during a calendar or fiscal year if the proposed project or projects are described in the bid specifications. 

(d) 
A board of aviation commissioners or an airport authority board may purchase or lease materials in the manner provided in IC 5-22 and perform any public work by means of its own workforce and owned or leased equipment, in the construction, maintenance, and repair of any airport roadway, runway, taxiway, or aircraft parking apron whenever the cost of that public work project is estimated to be less than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). 

(e) 
Municipal and county hospitals must comply with this chapter for all contracts for public work that are financed in whole or in part with cumulative building fund revenue, as provided in section 1(c) of this chapter. However, if the cost of the public work is estimated to be less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), as reflected in the board minutes, the hospital board may have the public work done without receiving bids, by purchasing the materials and performing 


the work by means of its own workforce and owned or leased equipment. 
(f) If a public works project involves a structure, an improvement, or a facility under the control of a department (as defined in IC 4-3-19-2(2)), the department may not artificially divide the project to bring any part of the project under this section.

IC 36-1-12-3.5 Contracts for engineering, architectural, or accounting services; applicability of restrictions of general statutes 
Sec. 3.5. When any public work is proposed to be performed and the board determines by a two-thirds (2/3) vote that it is expedient and in the best public interest to employ professional engineering, architectural, or accounting services for the planning and financing of the public work and the preparation of plans and specifications, then the limitations and restrictions in the general statutes with respect to invalidity of contracts without an appropriation therefor, payment of fees solely from the proceeds of bonds or assessments when and if issued, and payment of fees solely from a special fund or funds to be provided in the future, do not apply to contracts for those professional services to the extent that such limitations and restrictions might otherwise prevent the payment of fees for services actually rendered in connection with those contracts or affect the obligation to pay those fees.

Sec. 12. (a) When a public work project is to be performed, the board shall withhold final payment to the contractor until the contractor has paid the subcontractors, material suppliers, laborers, and those furnishing services. However, if there is not a sufficient sum owed to the contractor to pay those bills, the sum owed to the contractor shall be prorated in payment of the bills among the claimants entitled to payment. 
(b) 
To receive payment a subcontractor, material supplier, laborer, or person furnishing services must file a claim with the board not later than sixty (60) days after that person performed the last labor, furnished the last material, or performed the last service as provided in section 13 of this chapter.

(d) 
If there is a dispute among the claimants, the board shall retain sufficient money to pay the claims until the dispute is settled and the 

correct amount is determined.

IC 36-1-12-13.1 Payment bond for public work projects in excess of $200,000; claims; suits on bond; waiver of payment bond 
Sec. 13.1. (a) Except as provided in subsection (e), the appropriate political subdivision or agency: 
(1) 
shall require the contractor to execute a payment bond to the appropriate political subdivision or agency, approved by and for the benefit of the political subdivision or agency, in an amount equal to the contract price if the cost of the public work is estimated to be more than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000); and 

(2) 
may require the contractor to execute a payment bond to the appropriate political subdivision or agency, approved by and for the benefit of the political subdivision or agency, in an amount equal to the contract price if the cost of the public work is estimated to be not more than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). 


The payment bond is binding on the contractor, the subcontractor, and their successors and assigns for the payment of all indebtedness to a person for labor and service performed, material furnished, or services rendered. The payment bond must state that it is for the benefit of the subcontractors, laborers, material suppliers, and those performing services. 
(b) The payment bond shall be deposited with the board. The payment bond must specify that: 
(1) 
a modification, omission, or addition to the terms and conditions of the public work contract, plans, specifications, drawings, or profile; 

(2) 
a defect in the public work contract; or 

(3) 
a defect in the proceedings preliminary to the letting and 


awarding of the public work contract; does not discharge the surety. The surety of the payment bond may not be released until one (1) year after the board's final settlement with the contractor. 
(c) 
A person to whom money is due for labor performed, material furnished, or services provided must, not later than sixty (60) days after that person completed the labor or service or after that person furnished the last item of material: 

(1) file with the board signed duplicate statements of the amount due; and 

(2) 
deliver a copy of the statement to the contractor. The board shall forward to the surety of the payment bond one (1) of the signed duplicate statements. However, failure of the board to forward a signed duplicate statement does not affect the rights of a person to whom money is due. In addition, a failure of the board to forward the statement does not operate as a defense for the surety. 

(d) An action may not be brought against the surety before thirty 

(30)
 days after: 

(1) the filing of the signed duplicate statements with the board; and 

(2) 
delivery of a copy of the statement to the contractor. If the indebtedness is not paid in full at the end of that thirty (30) day period the person may bring an action in court. The court action must be brought not later than sixty (60) days after the date of the final completion and acceptance of the public work.

(1) 
that: 

(A) 
an otherwise responsive and responsible bidder is unable to provide the payment bond; or 

(B) 
the cost or coverage of the payment bond is not in the best interest of the project; and 



(2) 
that an adequate alternative is provided through a letter of credit, additional retainage of at least ten percent (10%) of the 




contract amount, a joint payable check system, or other sufficient protective mechanism.

Sec. 14. (a) This section applies to public work contracts in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000) for projects other than highways, roads, streets, alleys, bridges, and appurtenant structures situated on streets, alleys, and dedicated highway rights-of-way. A board may require a contractor and subcontractor to include contract provisions for retainage as set forth in this section for contracts that are not more than two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000). This section also applies to a lessor corporation qualifying under IC 20-47-2 or IC 20-47-3 or any other lease-back arrangement containing an option to purchase, notwithstanding the statutory provisions governing those leases. 
(b) 
A board that enters into a contract for public work, and a contractor who subcontracts parts of that contract, shall include in their respective contracts provisions for the retainage of portions of payments by the board to contractors, by contractors to subcontractors, and for the payment of subcontractors. At the discretion of the contractor, the retainage shall be held by the board or shall be placed in an escrow account with a bank, savings and loan institution, or the state as the escrow agent. The escrow agent shall be selected by mutual agreement between board and contractor or contractor and subcontractor under a written agreement among the bank or savings and loan institution and: 

(1) the board and the contractor; or 

(2) 
the subcontractor and the contractor. The board shall not be required to pay interest on the amounts of retainage that it holds under this section. 

(c) 
To determine the amount of retainage to be withheld, the board shall: 

(1) 
withhold no more than ten percent (10%) nor less than six percent (6%) of the dollar value of all work satisfactorily completed until the public work is fifty percent (50%) completed, and nothing further after that; or 

(2) 
withhold no more than five percent (5%) nor less than three percent (3%) of the dollar value of all work satisfactorily completed until the public work is substantially completed. 




If upon substantial completion of the public work minor items remain uncompleted, an amount computed under subsection (f) shall be withheld until those items are completed. 
(d) The escrow agreement must contain the following provisions: 
(1) 
The escrow agent shall invest all escrowed principal in obligations selected by the escrow agent. 

(2) 
The escrow agent shall hold the escrowed principal and income until receipt of notice from the board and the contractor, or the contractor and the subcontractor, specifying the part of the escrowed principal to be released from the escrow and the person to whom that portion is to be released. After receipt of the notice, the escrow agent shall remit the designated part of escrowed principal and the same proportion of then escrowed income to the person specified in the notice. 

(3) 
The escrow agent shall be compensated for the agent's services. The parties may agree on a reasonable fee comparable with fees being charged for the handling of escrow accounts of similar size and duration. The fee shall be paid from the escrowed income. 


The escrow agreement may include other terms and conditions consistent with this subsection, including provisions authorizing the escrow agent to commingle the escrowed funds with funds held in other escrow accounts and limiting the liability of the escrow agent. 
(e) Except as provided by subsections (i) and (h), the contractor shall furnish the board with a performance bond equal to the contract price. If acceptable to the board, the performance bond may provide for incremental bonding in the form of multiple or chronological bonds that, when taken as a whole, equal the contract price. The surety on the performance bond may not be released until one (1) year after the date of the board's final settlement with the contractor. The performance bond must specify that: 
(1) 
a modification, omission, or addition to the terms and conditions of the public work contract, plans, specifications, drawings, or profile; 

(2) 
a defect in the public work contract; or 

(3) 
a defect in the proceedings preliminary to the letting and 


awarding of the public work contract; does not discharge the surety. 
(f) 
The board or escrow agent shall pay the contractor within sixty-one (61) days after the date of substantial completion, subject to sections 11 and 12 of this chapter. Payment by the escrow agent shall include all escrowed principal and escrowed income. If within sixty-one (61) days after the date of substantial completion there remain uncompleted minor items, an amount equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the value of each item as determined by the architect-engineer shall be withheld until the item is completed. Required warranties begin not later than the date of substantial completion. 

(g) 
Actions against a surety on a performance bond must be brought within one (1) year after the date of the board's final settlement with the contractor. 

(h) 
This subsection applies to public work contracts of less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). The board may waive the performance bond requirement of subsection (e) and accept from a contractor an irrevocable letter of credit for an equivalent amount from an Indiana financial institution approved by the department of financial institutions instead of a performance bond. Subsections (e) through (g) apply to a letter of credit submitted under this subsection. 

(i) 
This subsection applies to the Indiana stadium and convention building authority created by IC 5-1-17-6. The board awarding the contract for a capital improvement project may waive any performance bond requirement if the board, after public notice and hearing, determines: 

(1) 
that: 

(A) 
an otherwise responsive and responsible bidder is unable to provide the performance bond; or 

(B) 
the cost or coverage of the performance bond is not in the best interest of the project; and 



(2) 
that an adequate alternative is provided through a letter of credit, additional retainage of at least ten percent (10%) of the contract amount, a joint payable check system, or other sufficient protective mechanism.
