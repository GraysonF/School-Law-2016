The following may not be used as grounds to rebut the presumption under subsection (a): 

(1) 
The child who is the victim of the offense described in IC 31-34-1-3 is not genetically related to the adult who committed the act, but the child presumed to be the child in need of services under this section is genetically related to the adult who committed the act.

the date of the original dispositional decree; or

a guardian ad litem or court appointed special advocate for the child; 

(B) 
a case manager; or

the person with whom the child is living and who has primary responsibility for the care and supervision of the child; 




in an age appropriate manner as determined by the court, regarding the proposed permanency plan; 
(5) 
consider and approve a permanency plan for the child that complies with the requirements set forth in section 7.5 of this chapter; 

(6)

(7) 
examine procedural safeguards used by the department to protect parental rights. 


(c)

Require the department to provide notice of the permanency hearing to the child, in accordance with section 4(a) of this chapter.

(4) 
Ask the child about the desired permanency outcome for the child and document the child's response. 

(5) 
Make a judicial determination explaining why, as of the date of the hearing, another planned permanent living arrangement is the best permanency plan for the child and provide compelling reasons why it continues to not be in the best interests of the child to: 

(A) 
return home; 

(B) 
be placed for adoption; 

(C) 
be placed with a legal guardian; or 

(D)

There is a rebuttable presumption that jurisdiction over the child in a child in need of services proceeding continues for not longer than twelve (12) months after the date of the original dispositional decree or twelve (12) months after the child in need of services was removed from the child's parent, guardian, or custodian, whichever occurs first. The state may rebut the presumption and show that jurisdiction should continue by proving that the objectives of the dispositional decree have not been accomplished, that a 


continuation of the decree with or without any modifications is necessary, and that it is in the child's best interests for the court to maintain its jurisdiction over the child. If the department does not sustain its burden for continued jurisdiction, the court shall: 
(1) 
direct the department to establish a permanency plan within thirty (30) days; or 

(2) 
discharge the child and the child's parent, guardian, or 


custodian. The court may retain jurisdiction to the extent necessary to carry out any orders under subdivision (1). As added by P.L.1-1997, SEC.17.
