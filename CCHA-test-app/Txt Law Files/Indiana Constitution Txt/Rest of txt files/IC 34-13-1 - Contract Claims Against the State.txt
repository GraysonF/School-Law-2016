Sec. 5. (a) Civil actions relating to acts taken by a board, a committee, a commission, an authority, or another instrumentality of a governmental entity may be brought only against the board, the committee, the commission, the authority, or the other instrumentality of a governmental entity. A member of a board, a committee, a commission, an authority, or another instrumentality of a governmental entity may not be named as a party in a civil suit that concerns the acts taken by a board, a committee, a commission, an authority, or another instrumentality of a governmental entity where the member was acting within the scope of the member's employment.

A lawsuit alleging that an employee acted within the scope of the employee's employment bars an action by the claimant against the employee personally. However, if the governmental entity answers that the employee acted outside the scope of the employee's employment, the plaintiff may amend the complaint and sue the employee personally. An amendment to the complaint by the plaintiff under this subsection must be filed not later than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the answer was filed and may be filed notwithstanding the fact that the statute of limitations has run. 

(c) 
A lawsuit filed against an employee personally must allege that an act or omission of the employee that causes a loss is: 

(1) 
criminal; 

(2) 
clearly outside the scope of the employee's employment; 

(3) 
malicious; 

(4) 
willful and wanton; or 



(5) 
calculated to benefit the employee personally. The complaint must contain a reasonable factual basis supporting the allegations. 

(d) 
This subsection applies when the governmental entity defends or has received proper legal notice and has the opportunity to defend an employee for losses resulting from the employee's acts or 

omissions. Subject to the provisions of sections 4, 14, 15, and 16 of this chapter, the governmental entity shall pay any judgment of a claim or suit against an employee when the act or omission causing the loss is within the scope of the employee's employment, regardless of whether the employee can or cannot be held personally liable for the loss. 

(e) 
The governmental entity shall provide counsel for and pay all costs and fees incurred by or on behalf of an employee in defense of a claim or suit for a loss occurring because of acts or omissions within the scope of the employee's employment, regardless of whether the employee can or cannot be held personally liable for the loss.

consent by the state of Indiana or its employees to be sued in any federal court; or
