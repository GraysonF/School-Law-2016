(h) 
With respect to an appeal of a real property assessment that takes effect on the assessment date on which a reassessment of real property takes effect under IC 6-1.1-4-4 or IC 6-1.1-4-4.2, the Indiana board shall make a determination not later than the later of:

(1) 
take no action and wait for the Indiana board to make a final determination; or 

(2) 
petition for judicial review under section 5 of this chapter. 



(j)
 A final determination must include separately stated findings of fact for all aspects of the determination. Findings of ultimate fact must be accompanied by a concise statement of the underlying basic facts of record to support the findings. Findings must be based exclusively upon the evidence on the record in the proceeding and on matters officially noticed in the proceeding. Findings must be based upon a preponderance of the evidence. 

(k) 
The Indiana board may limit the scope of the appeal to the issues raised in the petition and the evaluation of the evidence presented to the county board in support of those issues only if all parties participating in the hearing required under subsection (a) agree to the limitation. A party participating in the hearing required under subsection (a) is entitled to introduce evidence that is otherwise proper and admissible without regard to whether that evidence has previously been introduced at a hearing before the county board. 

(l) The Indiana board may require the parties to the appeal: 
(1) 
to file not more than five (5) business days before the date of the hearing required under subsection (a) documentary evidence or summaries of statements of testimonial evidence; and

The Indiana board may: 

(1) 
order that a final determination under this subsection has no precedential value; or 

(2) 
specify a limited precedential value of a final determination under this subsection.

(p) At a hearing under this section, the Indiana board shall admit into evidence an appraisal report, prepared by an appraiser, unless the appraisal report is ruled inadmissible on grounds besides a hearsay objection. This exception to the hearsay rule shall not be construed to limit the discretion of the Indiana board, as trier of fact, to review the probative value of an appraisal report.

IC 6-1.1-15-5 Rehearing; judicial review; procedure 
Sec. 5. (a) Not later than fifteen (15) days after the Indiana board gives notice of its final determination under section 4 of this chapter to the party or the maximum allowable time for the issuance of a final determination by the Indiana board under section 4 of this chapter expires, a party to the proceeding may request a rehearing before the Indiana board. The Indiana board may conduct a rehearing and affirm or modify its final determination, giving the same notices after the rehearing as are required by section 4 of this chapter. The Indiana board has fifteen (15) days after receiving a petition for a rehearing to determine whether to grant a rehearing. Failure to grant a rehearing not later than fifteen (15) days after receiving the petition shall be treated as a final determination to deny the petition. A petition for a rehearing does not toll the time in which to file a petition for judicial review unless the petition for rehearing is granted. If the Indiana board determines to rehear a final determination, the Indiana board: 
(1) 
may conduct the additional hearings that the Indiana board determines necessary or review the written record without additional hearings; and 

(2) 
shall issue a final determination not later than ninety (90) days after notifying the parties that the Indiana board will rehear the final determination. 


If the Indiana board fails to make a final determination within the time allowed under subdivision (2), the entity that initiated the petition for rehearing may take no action and wait for the Indiana board to make a final determination or petition for judicial review under subsection (g). 
(b) A party may petition for judicial review of the final determination of the Indiana board regarding the assessment or exemption of tangible property. In order to obtain judicial review under this section, a party must:

file a petition with the Indiana tax court; 

(2) 
serve a copy of the petition on: 

(A) 
the county assessor;

(C) 
any entity that filed an amicus curiae brief with the Indiana board; and 



(3) 
file a written notice of appeal with the Indiana board informing the Indiana board of the party's intent to obtain judicial review. 


Petitions for judicial review may be consolidated at the request of the appellants if it can be done in the interest of justice. The department of local government finance may intervene in an action taken under this subsection if the interpretation of a rule of the department is at issue in the action. The county assessor is a party to the review under this section. 
(c)
 Except as provided in subsection (g), to initiate a proceeding for judicial review under this section, a party must take the action required by subsection (b) not later than: 

(1) 
forty-five (45) days after the Indiana board gives the person notice of its final determination, unless a rehearing is conducted under subsection (a); or 

(2) 
forty-five (45) days after the Indiana board gives the person notice under subsection (a) of its final determination, if a rehearing is conducted under subsection (a) or the maximum time elapses for the Indiana board to make a determination under this section. 



(d) 
The failure of the Indiana board to conduct a hearing within the period prescribed in section 4(e) or 4(f) of this chapter does not constitute notice to the party of an Indiana board final determination. 

(e) 
The county assessor may petition for judicial review to the tax court in the manner prescribed in this section. 

(f) 
The county assessor may not be represented by the attorney general in a judicial review initiated under subsection (b) by the county assessor.

(1) a judicial proceeding is initiated under this subsection; and 
(2) the Indiana board has not issued a determination; the tax court shall determine the matter de novo. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.)

(1) 
the assessed value reported by the taxpayer on the taxpayer's personal property return if a personal property assessment, or an increase in such an assessment, is involved; or

As added by P.L.180-2016, SEC.9. 

IC 6-1.1-15-11 Refunds or tax credit 
Sec. 11. (a) If a review or appeal authorized under this chapter results in a reduction of the amount of an assessment or if the department of local government finance on its own motion reduces an assessment, the taxpayer is entitled to a credit in the amount of any overpayment of tax on the next successive tax installment, if any, due in that year. After the credit is given, the county auditor shall: 
(1) 
determine if a further amount is due the taxpayer; and

(a) Except as provided in subsection (d), this section applies to any review or appeal of an assessment under this chapter if the assessment that is the subject of the review or appeal is an increase of more than five percent (5%) over the assessment for the same property for the prior tax year. In calculating the change in the assessment for purposes of this section, the assessment to be used for the prior tax year is the original assessment for that prior tax year or, if applicable, the assessment for that prior tax year: 
(1) 
as last corrected by an assessing official; 

(2) 
as stipulated or settled by the taxpayer and the assessing official; or 

(3) 
as determined by the reviewing authority. 


(b) Under this section, the county assessor or township assessor making the assessment has the burden of proving that the assessment is correct in any review or appeal under this chapter and in any appeals taken to the Indiana board of tax review or to the Indiana tax court. If a county assessor or township assessor fails to meet the burden of proof under this section, the taxpayer may introduce evidence to prove the correct assessment.

as last corrected by an assessing official; 

(2) 
as stipulated or settled by the taxpayer and the assessing official; or

If the gross assessed value of real property for an assessment date that follows the latest assessment date that was the subject of an appeal described in this subsection is increased above the gross assessed value of the real property for the latest assessment date covered by the appeal, regardless of the amount of the increase, the county assessor or township assessor (if any) making the assessment has the burden of proving that the assessment is correct.
