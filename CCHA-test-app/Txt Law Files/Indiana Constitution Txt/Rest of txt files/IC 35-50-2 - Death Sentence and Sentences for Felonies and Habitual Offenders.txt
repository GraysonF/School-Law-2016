IC 35-50-2-7.1 Repealed 
(Repealed by P.L.164-1993, SEC.14.) 

IC 35-50-2-8 Habitual offenders 
Sec. 8. (a) The state may seek to have a person sentenced as a habitual offender for a felony by alleging, on one (1) or more pages separate from the rest of the charging instrument, that the person has accumulated the required number of prior unrelated felony convictions in accordance with this section. 
(b) 
A person convicted of murder or of a Level 1 through Level 4 felony is a habitual offender if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that: 

(1) 
the person has been convicted of two (2) prior unrelated felonies; and 

(2) 
at least one (1) of the prior unrelated felonies is not a Level 6 felony or a Class D felony. 



(c)
 A person convicted of a Level 5 felony is a habitual offender if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that: 

(1) 
the person has been convicted of two (2) prior unrelated felonies; 

(2) 
at least one (1) of the prior unrelated felonies is not a Level 6 felony or a Class D felony; and 

(3) 
if the person is alleged to have committed a prior unrelated: 

(A) 
Level 5 felony; 

(B) 
Level 6 felony; 

(C) 
Class C felony; or 



(D) 
Class D felony; not more than ten (10) years have elapsed between the time the person was released from imprisonment, probation, or parole (whichever is latest) and the time the person committed the current offense. 



(d) 
A person convicted of a felony offense is a habitual offender if the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that: 

(1) 
the person has been convicted of three (3) prior unrelated felonies; and 

(2) 
if the person is alleged to have committed a prior unrelated: 

(A) 
Level 5 felony; 

(B) 
Level 6 felony; 

(C) 
Class C felony; or 



(D) 
Class D felony; not more than ten (10) years have elapsed between the time the person was released from imprisonment, probation, or parole (whichever is latest) and the time the person committed the current offense. 



(e) 
The state may not seek to have a person sentenced as a habitual offender for a felony offense under this section if the current offense is a misdemeanor that is enhanced to a felony in the same proceeding as the habitual offender proceeding solely because the person had a prior unrelated conviction. However, a prior unrelated felony conviction may be used to support a habitual offender determination even if the sentence for the prior unrelated offense was enhanced for any reason, including an enhancement because the person had been convicted of another offense. 

(f) 
A person has accumulated two (2) or three (3) prior unrelated felony convictions for purposes of this section only if: 

(1) 
the second prior unrelated felony conviction was committed after commission of and sentencing for the first prior unrelated felony conviction; 

(2) 
the offense for which the state seeks to have the person sentenced as a habitual offender was committed after commission of and sentencing for the second prior unrelated felony conviction; and 

(3) 
for a conviction requiring proof of three (3) prior unrelated felonies, the third prior unrelated felony conviction was committed after commission of and sentencing for the second prior unrelated felony conviction. 



(g)
 A conviction does not count for purposes of this section as a prior unrelated felony conviction if: 

(1) 
the conviction has been set aside; or 

(2) 
the conviction is one for which the person has been pardoned. 



(h) 
If the person was convicted of the felony in a jury trial, the jury shall reconvene for the sentencing hearing. If the trial was to the court or the judgment was entered on a guilty plea, the court alone shall conduct the sentencing hearing under IC 35-38-1-3. The role of the jury is to determine whether the defendant has been convicted of the unrelated felonies. The state or defendant may not conduct any additional interrogation or questioning of the jury during the habitual offender part of the trial. 

(i) 
The court shall sentence a person found to be a habitual offender to an additional fixed term that is between: 

(1) 
six (6) years and twenty (20) years, for a person convicted of murder or a Level 1 through Level 4 felony; or 

(2) 
two (2) years and six (6) years, for a person convicted of a Level 5 or Level 6 felony. 




An additional term imposed under this subsection is nonsuspendible. 
(j) 
Habitual offender is a status that results in an enhanced sentence. It is not a separate crime and does not result in a consecutive sentence. The court shall attach the habitual offender enhancement to the felony conviction with the highest sentence imposed and specify which felony count is being enhanced. If the felony enhanced by the habitual offender determination is set aside or vacated, the court shall resentence the person and apply the habitual offender enhancement to the felony conviction with the next highest sentence in the underlying cause, if any. 

(k) 
A prior unrelated felony conviction may not be collaterally attacked during a habitual offender proceeding unless the conviction is constitutionally invalid. 

(l) 
The procedural safeguards that apply to other criminal charges, including: 


(1) the requirement that the charge be filed by information or indictment; and 
(2) the right to an initial hearing; also apply to a habitual offender allegation. As added by Acts 1976, P.L.148, SEC.8.

(d) 
If the defendant was convicted of murder in a jury trial, the jury shall reconvene for the sentencing hearing. If the trial was to the court, or the judgment was entered on a guilty plea, the court alone shall conduct the sentencing hearing. The jury or the court may consider all the evidence introduced at the trial stage of the proceedings, together with new evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. The court shall instruct the jury concerning the statutory penalties for murder and any other offenses for which the defendant was convicted, the potential for consecutive or concurrent sentencing, and the availability of educational credit, good time credit, and clemency. The court shall instruct the jury that, in order for the jury to recommend to the court that the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole should be imposed, the jury must find at least one (1) aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt as described in subsection (l) and shall provide a special verdict form for each aggravating circumstance alleged. The defendant may present any additional evidence relevant to: 

(1) 
the aggravating circumstances alleged; or 

(2)

(e) 
For a defendant sentenced after June 30, 2002, except as provided by IC 35-36-9, if the hearing is by jury, the jury shall recommend to the court whether the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole, or neither, should be imposed. The jury may recommend: 

(1) the death penalty; or 

(2) 
life imprisonment without parole; only if it makes the findings described in subsection (l). If the jury reaches a sentencing recommendation, the court shall sentence the defendant accordingly. After a court pronounces sentence, a representative of the victim's family and friends may present a statement regarding the impact of the crime on family and friends. The impact statement may be submitted in writing or given orally by the representative. The statement shall be given in the presence of the defendant. 

(f) 
If a jury is unable to agree on a sentence recommendation after reasonable deliberations, the court shall discharge the jury and proceed as if the hearing had been to the court alone. 

(g) 
If the hearing is to the court alone, except as provided by IC 35-36-9, the court shall: 

(1) sentence the defendant to death; or

(h) If a court sentences a defendant to death, the court shall order the defendant's execution to be carried out not later than one (1) year and one (1) day after the date the defendant was convicted. The supreme court has exclusive jurisdiction to stay the execution of a death sentence. If the supreme court stays the execution of a death sentence, the supreme court shall order a new date for the defendant's execution. 
(i) 
If a person sentenced to death by a court files a petition for post-conviction relief, the court, not later than ninety (90) days after the date the petition is filed, shall set a date to hold a hearing to consider the petition. If a court does not, within the ninety (90) day period, set the date to hold the hearing to consider the petition, the court's failure to set the hearing date is not a basis for additional post-conviction relief. The attorney general shall answer the petition for post-conviction relief on behalf of the state. At the request of the attorney general, a prosecuting attorney shall assist the attorney general. The court shall enter written findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning the petition not later than ninety (90) days after the date the hearing concludes. However, if the court determines that the petition is without merit, the court may dismiss the petition within ninety (90) days without conducting a hearing under this subsection. 

(j) 
A death sentence is subject to automatic review by the supreme court. The review, which shall be heard under rules adopted by the supreme court, shall be given priority over all other cases. The supreme court's review must take into consideration all claims that the: 

(1) 
conviction or sentence was in violation of the: 

(A) 
Constitution of the State of Indiana; or 

(B) 
Constitution of the United States; 



(2) 
sentencing court was without jurisdiction to impose a sentence; and 

(3) 
sentence: 


(A) exceeds the maximum sentence authorized by law; or 

(B) 
is otherwise erroneous. If the supreme court cannot complete its review by the date set by the sentencing court for the defendant's execution under subsection (h), the supreme court shall stay the execution of the death sentence and set a new date to carry out the defendant's execution. 

(k) 
A person who has been sentenced to death and who has completed state post-conviction review proceedings may file a written petition with the supreme court seeking to present new evidence challenging the person's guilt or the appropriateness of the death sentence if the person serves notice on the attorney general. The supreme court shall determine, with or without a hearing, whether the person has presented previously undiscovered evidence that undermines confidence in the conviction or the death sentence. If necessary, the supreme court may remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to consider the new evidence and its effect on the person's conviction and death sentence. The supreme court 

may not make a determination in the person's favor nor make a decision to remand the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing without first providing the attorney general with an opportunity to be heard on the matter. 

(l) 
Before a sentence may be imposed under this section, the jury, in a proceeding under subsection (e), or the court, in a proceeding under subsection (g), must find that: 

(1) 
the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one (1) of the aggravating circumstances listed in subsection (b) exists; and 

(2) 
any mitigating circumstances that exist are outweighed by the aggravating circumstance or circumstances.

under IC 35-42-4-1 through IC 35-42-4-9 or under IC 35-46-1-3; 

(2) 
for an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in subdivision (1); or

(b) 
The state may seek to have a person sentenced as a repeat sexual offender for a sex offense described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) by alleging, on a page separate from the rest of the charging instrument, that the person has accumulated one (1) prior unrelated felony conviction for a sex offense described in subsection (a). 

(c)
 After a person has been convicted and sentenced for a felony described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) after having been sentenced for a prior unrelated sex offense described in subsection (a), the person has accumulated one (1) prior unrelated felony sex offense conviction.

it has been set aside; or 

(2) 
it is a conviction for which the person has been pardoned. 



(d) 
If the person was convicted of the sex offense in a jury trial, the jury shall reconvene to hear evidence in the enhancement hearing. If the trial was to the court, or the judgment was entered on a guilty plea, the court alone shall hear evidence in the enhancement hearing. 

(e) 
A person is a repeat sexual offender if the jury (if the hearing is by jury) or the court (if the hearing is to the court alone) finds that the state has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the person had accumulated one (1) prior unrelated felony sex offense conviction. 


(f) The court may sentence a person found to be a repeat sexual offender to an additional fixed term that is the advisory sentence for the underlying offense. However, the additional sentence may not exceed ten (10) years. As added by P.L.214-1999, SEC.4.
