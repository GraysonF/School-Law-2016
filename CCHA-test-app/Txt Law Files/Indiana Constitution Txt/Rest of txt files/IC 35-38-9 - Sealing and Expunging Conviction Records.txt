may summarily deny the petition if the petition does not meet the requirements of this section, or if the statements contained in the petition indicate that the petitioner is not entitled to relief; and 

(2) 
shall grant the petition unless: 

(A) 
the conditions described in subsection (a) have not been met; or 

(B) 
criminal charges are pending against the person. 





(f) 
Whenever the petition of a person under this section is granted:

(1) 
any internal record made by a law enforcement agency at the time of the arrest and not intended for release to the public; or 

(2) 
records that relate to a diversion or deferral program. 


(i) If a person whose records are expunged brings an action that might be defended with the contents of the expunged records, the defendant is presumed to have a complete defense to the action. In order for the plaintiff to recover, the plaintiff must show that the contents of the expunged records would not exonerate the defendant. The plaintiff may be required to state under oath whether the plaintiff had records in the criminal justice system and whether those records were expunged.

(3) 
a court of appeals; and 



(4) 
the supreme court; concerning the person shall be permanently sealed. However, a petition for expungement granted under sections 2 through 3 of this chapter does not affect an existing or pending driver's license suspension. 

(c) 
If a petition to expunge conviction records is granted under sections 2 through 3 of this chapter with respect to the records of a person who is named as an appellant or an appellee in an opinion or memorandum decision by the supreme court or the court of appeals, the court shall: 

(1)

The supreme court and court of appeals are not required to destroy or otherwise dispose of any existing copy of an opinion or memorandum decision that includes the petitioner's name. 
(d) Notwithstanding subsection (b), a prosecuting attorney may submit a written application to a court that granted an expungement petition under this chapter to gain access to any records that were permanently sealed under subsection (b), if the records are relevant in a new prosecution of the person. If a prosecuting attorney who submits a written application under this subsection shows that the records are relevant for a new prosecution of the person, the court that granted the expungement petition shall: 
(1) 
order the records to be unsealed; and 

(2) 
allow the prosecuting attorney who submitted the written 


application to have access to the records. If a court orders records to be unsealed under this subsection, the court shall order the records to be permanently resealed at the earliest possible time after the reasons for unsealing the records cease to exist. However, if the records are admitted as evidence against the person in a new prosecution that results in the person's conviction, or are used to enhance a sentence imposed on the person in a new prosecution, the court is not required to reseal the records. 
(e) 
If a person whose conviction records are expunged under sections 2 through 5 of this chapter is required to register as a sex offender based on the commission of a felony which has been expunged: 

(1) 
the expungement does not affect the operation of the sex offender registry web site, any person's ability to access the person's records, records required to be maintained concerning sex or violent offenders, or any registration requirement 

imposed on the person; and 

(2) 
the expunged conviction must be clearly marked as expunged on the sex offender registry web site. 



(f) 
Expungement of a crime of domestic violence under section 2 of this chapter does not restore a person's right to possess a firearm. The right of a person convicted of a crime of domestic violence to possess a firearm may be restored only in accordance with IC 35-47-4-7. 

(g) 
If the court issues an order granting a petition for expungement under sections 2 through 3 of this chapter, the court shall include in its order the information described in section 8(b) of this chapter.

(b) 
The court records and other public records relating to the arrest, conviction, or sentence of a person whose conviction records have been marked as expunged remain public records. However, the court shall order that the records be clearly and visibly marked or identified as being expunged. A petition for expungement granted under sections 4 through 5 of this chapter does not affect an existing or pending driver's license suspension. 

(c) 
The state police department, the bureau of motor vehicles, and any other law enforcement agency in possession of records that relate to the conviction ordered to be marked as expunged shall add an entry to the person's record of arrest, conviction, or sentence in the criminal history data base stating that the record is marked as expunged. Nothing in this chapter prevents the bureau of motor vehicles from reporting information about a conviction for a violation of a traffic control law to the Commercial Drivers License Information System (CDLIS), in accordance with federal law, even if the conviction has been expunged under section 4 or 5 of this chapter. 

(d) 
If the court issues an order granting a petition for expungement under section 4 or 5 of this chapter, the court shall include in its order the information described in section 8(b) of this chapter.

(d)

A petitioner may seek to expunge more than one (1) conviction at the same time.

(i) 
This subsection applies only to a petition to expunge conviction records filed under sections 2 through 5 of this chapter. This subsection does not apply to a petition to expunge records related to the arrest, criminal charge, or juvenile delinquency allegation under section 1 of this chapter. Except as provided in subsections (j) and (k), a petitioner may file a petition for expungement only one (1) time during the petitioner's lifetime. For purposes of this subsection, all petitions for expungement filed in separate counties for offenses committed in those counties count as one (1) petition if they are filed in one (1) three hundred sixty-five 


(365) day period.

A petitioner whose petition for expungement has been denied, in whole or in part, may refile that petition for expungement, in whole or in part, with respect to one (1) or more convictions included in the initial expungement petition that were not expunged. However, if the petition was denied due to the court's exercise of its discretion under section 4 or 5 of this chapter, a petition for expungement may be refiled only after the elapse of three (3) years from the date on 

which the previous expungement petition was denied. Except as provided in subsection (k), a refiled petition for expungement may not include any conviction that was not included in the initial expungement petition. 

(k) 
A court may permit a petitioner to file an amended petition for expungement with respect to one (1) or more convictions that were not included in the initial expungement petition only if the court finds that: 

(1) 
the petitioner intended in good faith to comply with subsections (h) and (i); 

(2) 
the petitioner's failure to comply with subsections (h) and (i) was due to: 

(A) 
excusable neglect; or 

(B) 
circumstances beyond the petitioner's control; and 



(3) 
permitting the petitioner to file a subsequent petition for expungement is in the best interests of justice.

(e) 
A person whose record is expunged shall be treated as if the person had never been convicted of the offense. However, upon a subsequent arrest or conviction for an unrelated offense, the prior expunged conviction: 

(1) 
may be considered by the court in determining the sentence imposed for the new offense; 

(2)

a habitual offender enhancement; and

enhancing the new offense based on a prior conviction; and 



(3) 
may be admitted as evidence in the proceeding for a new offense as if the conviction had not been expunged.

(h) 
A conviction that has been expunged under this chapter is not admissible as evidence in an action for negligent hiring, admission, or licensure against a person or entity who relied on the order. 


(i) An expungement case, and all documents filed in the case, becomes confidential when the court issues the order granting the petition. However, until the court issues the order granting the petition, documents filed in the case are not confidential, and any hearing held in the case shall be open. As added by P.L.159-2013, SEC.4.
