A notice to appear on a day, to be fixed by the court, and show cause, if any, why the amounts requested should not be withdrawn and paid over by the circuit court clerk to those defendants requesting the amounts to be paid. 

(E) 
A copy of the request for payment. If a defendant not requesting payment is a nonresident of Indiana, or if that defendant's name or residence is unknown, publication and proof of the notice and request for payment shall be made as provided in section 4 of this chapter. 

(3) 
After a hearing held after notice of a written request made under this section, the court shall determine and order the payment by the circuit court clerk of the proportionate shares of the damages due to the defendants requesting payment. Any of the defendants may appeal an order under this subdivision within the same time and in the same manner as provided for allowable appeals from interlocutory orders in civil actions. 

(4) 
If exceptions to the appraisers' report have been duly filed by the plaintiff or any defendant, the circuit court clerk may not 

make payment to any defendant of any part of the damages deposited with the clerk by the plaintiff until the defendants requesting payment have filed with the circuit court clerk a written undertaking, with surety approved by the court, for the repayment to the plaintiff of all sums received by those defendants in excess of the amount or amounts awarded as damages to those defendants by the judgment of the court upon trial held on the exceptions to the assessment of damages by the appraisers. However, the court may waive the requirement of separate surety as to any defendant who is a resident freeholder of the county in which the cause is pending and who is owner of real property in Indiana that is liable to execution, not included in the real property appropriated by the plaintiff, and equal in value to the amount by which the damages to be withdrawn exceed the amount offered to the defendants as stated in their request or the amount determined by the court if the plaintiff has disputed the statement of the offer. A surety or written undertaking may not be required for a defendant to withdraw those amounts previously offered by the plaintiff to the defendant if the plaintiff has previously notified the court in writing of the amounts so offered. The liability of any surety does not exceed the amount by which the damages to be withdrawn exceed the amount offered to the defendants with whom the surety joins in the written undertaking. Each written undertaking filed with the circuit court clerk shall be immediately recorded by the clerk in the order book and entered in the judgment docket, and from the date of the recording and entry the written undertaking is a lien upon all the real property in the county owned by the several obligors, and the undertaking is also a lien upon all the real property owned by the several obligors in each county of Indiana in which the plaintiff causes a certified copy of the judgment docket entry to be recorded, from the date of the recording. 

(5) 
The withdrawal and receipt from the circuit court clerk by any defendant of that defendant's proportionate share of the damages awarded by the appraisers, as determined by the court upon the written request and hearing, does not operate and is not considered as a waiver of any exceptions duly filed by that defendant to the assessment of damages by the appraisers. 

(6) 
In any trial of exceptions, the court or jury shall compute and allow interest at an annual rate of eight percent (8%) on the amount of a defendant's damages from the date plaintiff takes possession of the property. Interest may not be allowed on any money paid by the plaintiff to the circuit court clerk: 

(A) 
after the money is withdrawn by the defendant; or 

(B) 
that is equal to the amount of damages previously offered by the plaintiff to any defendant and which amount can be withdrawn by the defendant without filing a written 




undertaking or surety with the court for the withdrawal of that amount.

(b) 
The fiscal officer of the municipality shall immediately prepare a list of the excess of benefits, to be known as the local assessment list. If the municipality is a second class city and the county treasurer collects money due the city, the local assessment list shall be delivered to the county treasurer. 

(c) 
The duties of the fiscal officer of the municipality and county treasurer are the same as prescribed with regard to assessments for street improvement. The provisions of the statute relating to:

All benefits assessed and collected by the fiscal officer or county treasurer are subject to draft, in the usual manner, upon certificate by the works board in favor of persons to whom damages have been awarded. Any surplus remaining above actual awards belongs to the municipality. The works board may delay proceedings until the benefits have been collected.

IC 32-24-2-15 Certificates of damages; disputes as to whom damages should be paid; injunction 
Sec. 15. (a) Upon completion of the award of damages or whenever any time for delay as provided has expired, the works board shall make out certificates for the proper amounts and in favor of the proper persons. Presentation of the certificates to the fiscal officer of the municipality entitles the person to a warrant on the fiscal officer or the county treasurer. The certificates or vouchers shall, whenever practicable, be actually tendered to the persons entitled to them, but when this is impracticable, they shall be kept for the persons in the office of the works board. The making and fixing of the certificate is a valid and effectual tender to the person entitled to it, and the certificate must be delivered to that person on request. 
(b) If a dispute or doubt arises as to which person the money shall be paid, the works board shall make out the certificate in favor of the municipality's attorney for the use of the persons entitled to it. The attorney shall draw the money and pay it into court in a proper proceeding, requiring the various claimants to interplead and have their respective rights determined. 
(c) If an injunction is obtained because damages have not been paid or tendered, the works board may tender the certificate for the amount with interest from the time of entry upon the property, if any has been made, including all accrued costs. The injunction shall then be dissolved. The pendency of an appeal does not affect the validity of a tender made under this section, but the municipality may proceed with its acquisition of the property in question. However, when a lot or parcel has sustained both benefits and damages because of improvements as stated in the assessment list, only an excess of damages awarded over benefits assessed is payable under this section. As added by P.L.2-2002, SEC.9.

(b) The works board shall adopt a resolution that the municipality wants to acquire the property, describing the property that may be injuriously or beneficially affected. All proceedings necessary for the completion of and payment for any such undertaking, including notice, remonstrance, appeal, letting of and performance of contracts, assessment and collection of payment for benefits, and the determination and payment of damages to property, are the same, to the extent applicable, as those proceedings for street improvements of the municipality by its works board or other entity charged by statute with the performance of those duties on behalf of the municipality.

Sec. 4. (a) This section applies to a public utility that appropriates by condemnation procedures an easement for right-of-way purposes on land zoned or used for agricultural purposes. 
(b) 
If a public utility makes a uniform easement acquisition offer under IC 32-24-1-5 or a settlement offer under IC 32-24-1-12 in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000), the owner of the land may elect to accept as compensation either a lump sum payment or annual payments for a period not to exceed twenty (20) years. 

(c) 
The landowner must elect either the lump sum payment or the annual payment method at the time the landowner: 

(1) 
accepts the public utility's offer under IC 32-24-1-5 or IC 32-24-1-12 to purchase an easement; 

(2) 
accepts the appraisers' award; or 

(3) 
is awarded damages by a judgment in a proceeding under 




this article. The grant of easement or judgment, whichever is applicable, must state the method of payment the landowner has elected to receive. 
(d) 
If the land is owned by more than one (1) person, the election to receive annual payments must be unanimous among all record owners to be binding upon the public utility. 

(e) 
Selection of the lump sum method of payment irrevocably binds the landowner and the landowner's successors in interest. 

(f) 
The annual amount payable must be equal to the lump sum payment that would have otherwise been made by the utility divided by the number of years the landowner elects to receive the annual payments plus interest at a rate agreed upon by the public utility and the landowner on the balance remaining at the end of each year. The public utility shall make the annual payment as close as practicable to the date of the landowner's acceptance of the public utility's offer or the date of the judgment granting the utility the easement. If the public utility and the landowner are unable to agree upon the interest rate, the interest rate shall be the average annual effective interest rate for all new Federal Land Bank Loans, computed on the basis of the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date of settlement. 

(g) 
A landowner who withdraws the appraisers' award under IC 32-24-1-11 may receive only a lump sum payment from the clerk at that time. If the landowner is later awarded a judgment for damages that exceeds the amount of the appraisers' award, the landowner may elect either method of compensation only to the extent that the damages exceed the appraisers' award remaining to be paid by the public utility as a result of the judgment. 

(h) 
A landowner who elects the annual payment method may terminate the election by giving notarized written notice to the public utility at least ninety (90) days before the annual date of payment. The public utility may prescribe reasonable forms for the notice and may require that these forms be used for the notice to be effective. In the event the landowner terminates this election, the public utility shall pay the landowner in a single payment the difference between the lump sum and the total of all annual payments previously paid by 

the public utility. Upon the landowner's receipt of this payment, the public utility's payment obligations cease. 

(i) 
If a landowner sells the landowner's entire interest in the servient estate, the landowner shall give the public utility prompt notarized written notice of the sale, together with a copy of the deed specifying the name and address of the landowner's successor in interest. If the public utility receives the notice less than ninety (90) days before the date of an annual payment, the public utility may make this annual payment to the landowner but must make all successive payments to the landowner's successors and assigns. 

(j) 
If a landowner sells less than the landowner's entire interest in the servient estate, the public utility may continue to make the annual payments to the landowner. 

(k) 
A public utility shall make annual payments to the landowner only for the time the servient estate continues to be zoned or used for agricultural purposes. If the servient estate is no longer zoned or used for agricultural purposes, the public utility shall pay to the landowner the difference between the lump sum and the total of all annual payments previously paid by the public utility. Upon the landowner's receipt of this payment, the public utility's payment obligations cease. 

(l) 
This section is binding upon the heirs, successors, and assigns of the landowner and the public utility.
