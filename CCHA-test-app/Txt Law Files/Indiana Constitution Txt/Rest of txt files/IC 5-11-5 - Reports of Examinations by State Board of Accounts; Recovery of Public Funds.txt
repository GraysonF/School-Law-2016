IC 5-11-5 
Chapter 5. Reports of Examinations by State Board of Accounts; Recovery of Public Funds 
IC 5-11-5-1 Examination reports; exit conferences; disclosure of examination results; attorney general actions 
Sec. 1. (a) Whenever an examination is made under this article, a report of the examination shall be made. The report must include a list of findings and shall be signed and verified by the examiner making the examination. A finding that is critical of an examined entity must be based upon one (1) of the following: 
(1) Failure of the entity to observe a uniform compliance guideline established under IC 5-11-1-24(a). 
(2) 
Failure of the entity to comply with a specific law. A report that includes a finding that is critical of an examined entity must designate the uniform compliance guideline or the specific law upon which the finding is based. The reports shall immediately be filed with the state examiner, and, after inspection of the report, the state examiner shall immediately file one (1) copy with the officer or person examined, one (1) copy with the auditing department of the municipality examined and reported upon (if the subject of the report is a municipality), and one (1) copy in an electronic format under IC 5-14-6 with the legislative services agency, as staff to the audit committee and the general assembly. Upon filing, the report becomes a part of the public records of the office of the state examiner, of the office or the person examined, of the auditing department of the municipality examined and reported upon, and of the legislative services agency, as staff to the audit committee and the general assembly. A report is open to public inspection at all reasonable times after it is filed. If an examination discloses malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office or of any officer or employee, a copy of the report, signed and verified, shall be placed by the state examiner with the attorney general and the inspector general. The attorney general shall diligently institute and prosecute civil proceedings against the delinquent officer, or upon the officer's official bond, or both, and against any other proper person that will secure to the state or to the proper municipality the recovery of any funds misappropriated, diverted, or unaccounted for. 

(b) 
Before an examination report is signed, verified, and filed as required by subsection (a), the officer or the chief executive officer of the state office, municipality, or entity examined must have an opportunity to review the report and to file with the state examiner a written response to that report. If a written response is filed, it becomes a part of the examination report that is signed, verified, and filed as required by subsection (a). As part of the review of the examination report, the state examiner shall hold a gathering of the officer or chief executive officer of the state office, municipality, or 


entity examined, any employees or agents of the state office, municipality, or entity examined who are requested to attend by the officer or chief executive officer of the state office, municipality, or entity examined, and the members of the legislative and fiscal bodies of the municipality or entity examined. Such a gathering is referred to as an "exit conference" for purposes of this subsection. The following apply to an exit conference: 
(1) 
All information discussed and materials presented or delivered by any person during an exit conference are confidential and may not be discussed or shared publicly until the earliest of the occurrences set forth in subsection (g). However, the information discussed and materials presented or delivered during an exit conference may be shared with an officer, employee, consultant, adviser, or attorney of the officer or chief executive officer of the state office, municipality, or entity examined who was not present at the exit conference. An individual with whom information and materials are shared must maintain the confidentiality of the information and materials as provided in this subdivision until the earliest of the occurrences set forth in subsection (g). 

(2) 
An individual attending an exit conference may not electronically record the exit conference. 

(3) 
If a majority of a governing body (as defined in IC 5-14-1.5-2(b)) is present during an exit conference, the governing body shall be considered in an executive session under IC 5-14-1.5. However, the governing body has no obligation to give notice as prescribed by IC 5-14-1.5-5 when it participates in the exit conference. 

(4) 
If the state examiner determines after the exit conference that additional actions must be undertaken by a deputy examiner, field examiner, or private examiner with respect to information discussed or materials presented at the exit conference, the state examiner may call for an additional exit conference to be held. 

(5) 
Not more than thirty (30) days after the initial exit conference is held under this subsection, the legislative body of the municipality or entity examined and reported upon may adopt a resolution, approved by at least a two-thirds (2/3) vote of the legislative body, requesting that an additional exit conference be held. The legislative body shall notify the state board of accounts if the legislative body adopts a resolution under this subdivision. If a legislative body adopts a resolution under this subdivision, the state board of accounts shall conduct an additional exit conference not more than sixty (60) days after the state board of accounts receives notice of the adoption of the resolution. The municipality or entity examined must pay the travel and staff costs incurred by the state board of accounts in conducting an additional exit conference under this 

subdivision. 

(6) 
Except as provided in subdivision (7), a final report under subsection (a) may not be issued earlier than forty-five (45) days after the initial exit conference is held under this subsection. 

(7) 
If: 

(A) 
the state examiner does not call for an additional exit conference to be held as described in subdivision (4); and 

(B) 
the: 

(i) 
legislative body of the municipality or entity examined and reported upon provides written notice to the state examiner that the legislative body waives an additional exit conference described in subdivision (5); or 

(ii) 
state examiner determines that a final report under 






subsection (a) must be issued as soon as possible; the final report may be issued earlier than forty-five (45) days after the initial exit conference is held under this subsection. 
(c) Except as provided by subsections (b), (d), and (e), it is unlawful for any person, before an examination report is made public as provided by this section, to make any disclosure of the result of any examination of any public account, except: 
(1) 
to the state examiner; 

(2) 
if directed to give publicity to the examination report by the state examiner or by any court; 

(3) 
to another deputy examiner, field examiner, or private examiner engaged in conducting the examination; or 

(4) 
if directed by the state examiner, to the chair of the audit committee or the members of the audit committee acting in executive session, or both. 


If an examination report shows or discloses the commission of a crime by any person, it is the duty of the state examiner to transmit and present the examination report to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which the crime was committed. The state examiner shall furnish to the prosecuting attorney all evidence at the state examiner's command necessary in the investigation and prosecution of the crime. 
(d) 
If, during an examination under this article, a deputy examiner, field examiner, or private examiner acting as an agent of the state examiner determines that the following conditions are satisfied, the examiner shall report the determination to the state examiner: 

(1) 
A substantial amount of public funds has been misappropriated or diverted. 

(2) 
The deputy examiner, field examiner, or private examiner acting as an agent of the state examiner has a reasonable belief that the malfeasance or misfeasance that resulted in the misappropriation or diversion of the public funds was committed by the officer or an employee of the office. 



(e) 
After receiving a preliminary report under subsection (d), the state examiner may provide a copy of the report to the attorney general. The attorney general may institute and prosecute civil proceedings against the delinquent officer or employee, or upon the officer's or employee's official bond, or both, and against any other proper person that will secure to the state or to the proper municipality the recovery of any funds misappropriated, diverted, or unaccounted for. 

(f) 
In an action under subsection (e), the attorney general may attach the defendant's property under IC 34-25-2. 

(g)

The final report is made public under subsection (a). 

(2) 
The results of the examination are publicized under subsection (c)(2).

(2) 
If the disclosure is by a person who is not described in subdivision (1), the person commits a Class A infraction.

IC 5-11-5-4 Party to actions; plaintiff's right of recovery 
Sec. 4. Any action brought by the attorney general, as provided in this article, may be brought in the name, as plaintiff, of the state of Indiana, or such municipality or subdivision of the state of Indiana as it may appear is entitled to recover moneys or to secure other relief under such action. If the action is brought on an official bond or official bonds, the cause may be brought in the name of the state of Indiana on the relation of such plaintiff. In an action against a township trustee, or ex-township trustee, or upon his official bond, both the civil and school corporations may be named as plaintiff or relator in the same action, and recovery may be had for the aggregate amount due both corporations, but the court or jury trying the case shall, in the finding or verdict, state the amount due each corporation. In an action where a board of commissioners is plaintiff or relator, the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover against the delinquent officer or ex-officer, or upon his official bond or bonds, all such amounts as would be recoverable under all the laws of this state, including this chapter, in any or all actions by or upon the relation of the board of commissioners, or by or upon the relation of any county officer or other person authorized to sue for whatever funds, or for any funds of which it is the custodian and with which it is chargeable, and in case any of the funds so recovered are school funds, the court or jury trying the case shall find and state the amount thereof. In any action brought under this article, the plaintiff shall be entitled to recover, in addition to the amount misappropriated, diverted or unaccounted for, all such penalties and interest as might be recoverable under laws other than this chapter. 
The term municipality, as used in this article, shall be construed to extend to, include and mean any county, township, city, town, school corporation, special taxing district or other political subdivision of Indiana. (Formerly: Acts 1917, c.115, s.4.) As amended by Acts 1980, P.L.30, SEC.18. 

IC 5-11-5-5 Cumulative remedies 
Sec. 5. The remedies provided for in this chapter are cumulative, and this chapter shall not be construed to abridge the rights of other officers to sue on behalf of municipalities, except to the extent that where the attorney general has brought an action under the authority of this chapter no other action shall be brought for the same matter while such action brought by the attorney general is pending, and excepting as other statutes relating thereto are expressly repealed by Acts 1917, c.115, s.7. (Formerly: Acts 1917, c.115, s.5.) As amended by P.L.25-1986, SEC.39.
