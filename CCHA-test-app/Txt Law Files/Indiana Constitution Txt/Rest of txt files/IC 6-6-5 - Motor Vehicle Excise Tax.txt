IC 6-6-5-7.2 Application of section; proration of tax; credits; refund for destroyed vehicle not replaced 
Sec. 7.2. (a) This section applies to a vehicle that has been acquired, or brought into the state, or for any other reason becomes subject to registration after the regular annual registration date in the year on or before which the owner of the vehicle is required, under the motor vehicle registration laws of Indiana, to register vehicles. The tax imposed by this chapter shall become due and payable at the time the vehicle is acquired, brought into the state, or otherwise becomes subject to registration. 
(b) 
For taxes due and payable before January 1, 2017, the amount of tax to be paid by the owner for the remainder of the year shall be reduced by eight and thirty-three hundredths percent (8.33%) for each full calendar month that has elapsed since the regular annual registration date in the year fixed by the motor vehicle registration laws for annual registration by the owner. The tax shall be paid by the owner at the time of the registration of the vehicle. 

(c) 
For taxes due and payable after December 31, 2016, the tax shall be paid by the owner at the time of the registration of the vehicle and is determined as follows: 


(1) For a vehicle with an initial registration period under IC 9-18.1-11-3, the amount determined under STEP THREE of the following formula: 
STEP ONE: Determine the number of months remaining until the vehicle's next registration date under IC 9-18.1-11-3. A partial month shall be rounded up to one 
(1) month. 
STEP TWO: Multiply the STEP ONE result by one-twelfth 
(1/12). 
STEP THREE: Multiply the annual excise tax for the vehicle 
by the STEP TWO product. 

(2) For a vehicle with a renewal registration period described in IC 9-18.1-11-3(b), the annual excise tax for the current registration period. 
(d) 
Except as provided in subsection (g), no reduction in the applicable annual excise tax will be allowed to an Indiana resident applicant upon registration of any vehicle that was owned by the applicant on or prior to the registrant's annual registration period. A vehicle owned by an Indiana resident applicant that was located in and registered for use in another state during the same calendar year shall be entitled to the same reduction when registered in Indiana. 

(e) 
The owner of a vehicle who sells the vehicle in a year in which the owner has paid the tax imposed by this chapter shall receive a credit equal to the remainder of: 

(1) 
the tax paid for the vehicle; reduced by 

(2) 
eight and thirty-three hundredths percent (8.33%) for each full or partial calendar month that has elapsed in the registrant's annual registration year before the date of the sale. 




The credit shall be applied to the tax due on any other vehicle purchased or subsequently registered by the owner in the same registrant's annual registration year. If the credit is not fully used and the amount of the credit remaining is at least four dollars ($4), the owner is entitled to a refund in the amount of the unused credit. The owner must pay a fee of three dollars ($3) to the bureau to cover costs of providing the refund, which may be deducted from the refund. The bureau shall issue the refund. The bureau shall transfer to the bureau of motor vehicles commission three dollars ($3) of the fee to cover the commission's costs in processing the refund. To claim the credit and refund provided by this subsection, the owner of the vehicle must present to the bureau proof of sale of the vehicle. 
(f) 
Subject to the requirements of subsection (h), the owner of a vehicle that is destroyed in a year in which the owner has paid the tax imposed by this chapter, which vehicle is not replaced by a replacement vehicle for which a credit is issued under this section, shall receive a refund in an amount equal to eight and thirty-three hundredths percent (8.33%) of the tax paid for each full calendar month remaining in the registrant's annual registration year after the date of destruction, but only upon presentation or return to the bureau of the following: 

(1) 
A request for refund on a form furnished by the bureau. 

(2) 
A statement of proof of destruction on an affidavit furnished by the bureau. 

(3) 
The license plate from the vehicle. 



(4) 
The registration from the vehicle. However, the refund may not exceed ninety percent (90%) of the tax paid on the destroyed vehicle. The amount shall be refunded by a warrant issued by the auditor of the county that received the excise tax revenue and shall be paid out of the special account created for settlement of the excise tax collections under IC 6-6-5-10. For purposes of this subsection, a vehicle is considered destroyed if the cost of repair of damages suffered by the vehicle exceeds the vehicle's fair market value. 

(g) 
If the name of the owner of a vehicle is legally changed and the change has caused a change in the owner's annual registration date, the excise tax liability of the owner shall be adjusted as follows: 

(1) 
If the name change requires the owner to register sooner than the owner would have been required to register if there had been no name change, the owner shall, at the time the name change is reported, be authorized a refund from the county treasurer in the amount of the product of: 

(A) 
eight and thirty-three hundredths percent (8.33%) of the owner's last preceding annual excise tax liability; and 

(B) 
the number of full calendar months between the owner's new regular annual registration month and the next succeeding regular annual registration month that is based on the owner's former name. 



(2) 
If the name change required the owner to register later than the owner would have been required to register if there had been no name change, the vehicle shall be subject to excise tax for the period between the month in which the owner would have been required to register if there had been no name change and the new regular annual registration month in the amount determined under STEP FOUR of the following formula: 




STEP ONE: Determine the number of full calendar months between the month in which the owner would have been required to register if there had been no name change and the owner's new regular annual registration month. STEP TWO: Multiply the STEP ONE amount by one-twelfth (1/12). STEP THREE: Determine the owner's tax liability computed as of the time the owner would have been required to register if there had been no name change. STEP FOUR: Multiply the STEP TWO product by the STEP THREE amount. 
(h) In order to claim a credit under subsection (f) for a vehicle that is destroyed, the owner of the vehicle must present to the bureau of motor vehicles a valid registration for the vehicle within ninety (90) days of the date that it was destroyed. The bureau shall then fix the amount of the credit that the owner is entitled to receive.

(c) 
To claim the refund provided by this section, the owner of the vehicle must provide the bureau with:

(b) 
For the months of January through November, the auditor of state shall determine a monthly uniform disbursement percentage to be applied in determining the amount of motor vehicle excise tax replacement money to be disbursed to each county.

(1) 
the amount that IC 4-30-17-3.5 requires the auditor of state to distribute from the build Indiana fund to the state general fund motor vehicle excise tax replacement account; and 

(2) 
the amount that is available for distribution from the build Indiana fund to the state general fund motor vehicle excise tax replacement account.

(c) 
As used in this subsection, "taxing district" has the meaning set forth in IC 6-1.1-1-20, "taxing unit" has the meaning set forth in IC 6-1.1-1-21, and "tuition support levy" refers to a school corporation's tuition support property tax levy under IC 20-45-3-11 (repealed) for the school corporation's general fund. The county auditor shall determine the total amount of excise taxes collected for each taxing district in the county and the amount so collected (and the distributions received under section 9.5 of this chapter) shall be apportioned and distributed among the respective funds of the taxing units in the same manner and at the same time as property taxes are apportioned and distributed (subject to adjustment as provided in IC 36-8-19-7.5). However, for purposes of determining distributions under this section for 2009 and each year thereafter, a state welfare and tuition support allocation shall be deducted from the total amount available for apportionment and distribution to taxing units under this section before any apportionment and distribution is made. The county auditor shall remit the state welfare and tuition support allocation to the treasurer of state for deposit, as directed by the budget agency. The amount of the state welfare and tuition support allocation for a county for a particular year is equal to the result determined under STEP FOUR of the following formula:

the aggregate tax rate imposed in the taxing district for the same year. 



(B) 
Determine the sum of the clause (A) amounts. 

(C) 
Divide the clause (B) amount by three (3). 

(D) 
Determine the result of:

(ii) 
the clause (C) amount. 



(E) 
Determine the sum of the clause (D) amounts for all 


taxing districts in the county. STEP THREE: Determine the result of the following:

the tuition support levy tax rate imposed in the taxing district plus the tax rate imposed by the school corporation for the school corporation's special education preschool fund in the district; divided by 

(ii) 
the aggregate tax rate imposed in the taxing district for the same year. 



(B) 
Determine the sum of the clause (A) amounts. 

(C) 
Divide the clause (B) amount by three (3). 

(D) 
Determine the result of: 

(i) 
the amount of excise taxes allocated to the taxing district that would otherwise be available for distribution to taxing units in the taxing district after subtracting the STEP ONE (D) amount for the same taxing district; multiplied by 

(ii) 
the clause (C) amount. 



(E) 
Determine the sum of the clause (D) amounts for all 


taxing districts in the county. STEP FOUR: Determine the sum of the STEP ONE, STEP TWO, and STEP THREE amounts for the county. 
If the boundaries of a taxing district change after the years for which a ratio is calculated under STEP ONE, STEP TWO, or STEP THREE, the auditor of state shall establish a ratio for the new taxing district that reflects the tax rates imposed in the predecessor taxing districts. If a new taxing district is established after the years for which a ratio is calculated under STEP ONE, STEP TWO, or STEP THREE, the auditor of state shall establish a ratio for the new taxing district and adjust the ratio for other taxing districts in the county.
