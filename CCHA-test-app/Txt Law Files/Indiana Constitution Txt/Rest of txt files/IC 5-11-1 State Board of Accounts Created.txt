IC 5-11 ARTICLE 11. ACCOUNTING FOR PUBLIC FUNDS 
IC 5-11-1 Chapter 1. State Board of Accounts Created 
IC 5-11-1-1 Establishment; members; appointment; qualifications; terms; tenure 
Sec. 1. (a) There is established a state board of accounts. The board consists of the state examiner and two (2) deputy examiners, as provided in this section. 
(b) 
The principal officer of the board is the state examiner. To hold the office of state examiner, an individual must: 

(1) 
be appointed by the governor; 

(2) 
have the individual's appointment accepted bythe legislative council in conformity with subsection (e); and 

(3) 
be a certified public accountant with at least five (5) years of accounting experience, including at least three (3) years of single audit experience in the public or private sector. 



(c) 
The governor shall also appoint two (2) deputy examiners. To hold the office of deputy examiner, an individual must: 

(1) be appointed by the governor; and 

(2) 
be a certified public accountant. A deputy examiner is subordinate to the state examiner. In the case of deputy examiners appointed after June 30, 2014, at least one (1) of the deputy examiners must have at least three (3) years of experience with the state board of accounts at the time of appointment. 

(d) 
Not more than two (2) of the three (3) individuals appointed to the state board of accounts may be members of the same political party. The term of a state examiner is four (4) years. However, the term of the state examiner serving on January 1, 2014, ends December 31, 2017. Notwithstanding the expiration of the term of a state examiner, the state examiner may continue to serve as acting state examiner until a state examiner is appointed or reappointed. The term of a deputy examiner is coterminous with the term of the state examiner. 

(e) 
The governor shall submit to the executive director of the legislative services agency in an electronic format under IC 5-14-6 the name of an individual who the governor recommends for appointment under subsection (b) along with any supporting information that the governor determines is appropriate. The executive director of the legislative services agency shall submit the governor's recommendation along with any submitted supporting information to the members of the legislative council and place the information on the Internet web site maintained by the general assembly. At a meeting open to the public, the legislative council 

may adopt a resolution to accept or reject a recommendation of the governor. The legislative council may reject a recommendation with or without cause. If the legislative council fails to adopt a resolution accepting or rejecting a recommendation within forty-five (45) days after the recommendation is submitted to the executive director of the legislative services agency in an electronic format under IC 5-14-6, the recommendation shall be treated as accepted by the legislative council. The state examiner serving on January 1, 2014, shall be treated as accepted by the legislative council to the same extent as if the legislative council had adopted a resolution that accepted the state examiner's appointment. 

(f) 
IC 4-21.5 applies to an action under this subsection. The state examiner and the deputy examiners are subject to removal by the governor for incompetency (including failure to maintain the individual's status as a certified public accountant) or for misconduct of the office. If the governor seeks to remove the state examiner under this subsection, the governor shall notify the state examiner in writing of the governor's proposed action in conformity with IC 4-21.5-3-4 and submit a copy of the notice to the executive director of the legislative services agency in an electronic format under IC 5-14-6. The notice must state the reasons for the proposed action and indicate that the state examiner has fifteen (15) days after being given notice to petition for review of the proposed action. The notice must specify that a petition for review of the proposed action must be made in writing and be submitted to the executive director of the legislative services agency in accordance with IC 4-21.5-3-7. The notice must also state that the state examiner may petition the legislative council under IC 4-21.5-3-4 for a stay of the proposed action pending final resolution of the matter. If a timely petition is filed with the executive director of the legislative services agency, the legislative council shall conduct a proceeding under IC 4-21.5 to review the petition. The determination by the legislative council is a final order. A state examiner removed from office under this subsection may petition for judicial review of a final action of the legislative council under IC 4-21.5-5 in the circuit or a superior court of Marion County. A deputy examiner removed from office under this subsection may petition for judicial review regarding the removal in the circuit or a superior court of Marion County.

(60) 
days.

Except as provided in this section, the person who initially filed the complaint may continue as a party to the action. 
(b) With the approval of the court, the attorney general or the inspector general may dismiss the action after: 
(1) 
notifying the person who initially filed the complaint; and 

(2) 
the court has conducted a hearing at which the person who initially filed the complaint was provided the opportunity to be heard on the motion. 


The court may consider a request by the attorney general or the inspector general to dismiss the action but is not bound by the request. Additionally, the court may permit the attorney general or inspector general to withdraw his or her appearance in the case and may permit the person who initially filed the complaint to continue to prosecute the action in the name of the state. 
(c) The attorney general or the inspector general may settle the action if a court determines, after a hearing, that the proposed settlement is fair, adequate, and reasonable in light of the circumstances. Upon a showing of good cause, the court may:

(2) 
lift all or part of the seal to facilitate the investigative

(d) Upon a showing by the attorney general, the inspector general, or the defendant that unrestricted participation by the person who initially filed the complaint: 
(1) 
will interfere with or unduly delay the prosecution of the case by the attorney general or the inspector general; 

(2) 
will involve the presentation of repetitious or irrelevant evidence, or evidence introduced for purposes of harassment; or 

(3) 
will cause the defendant to suffer undue burden or 


unnecessary expense; the court may impose reasonable limitations on the person's participation, including a limit on the number of witnesses that the person may call, a limit to the length of testimony that the person's witness may present, a limit to the person's cross-examination of a witness, or otherwise limit the participation by the person in the litigation.

(f) 
If the attorney general and the inspector general have elected not to intervene in an action in accordance with section 4 of this chapter, upon a showing of good cause, a court may permit either the attorney general or the inspector general to intervene at a later time. The attorney general may move to intervene at any time. If the attorney general has not moved to intervene, the inspector general may move to intervene by providing written notice to the attorney general of the inspector general's intent to intervene. If the attorney general does not move to intervene earlier than fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notice of intent to intervene, the inspector general may move to intervene. If the attorney general or the inspector general intervenes under this subsection, the attorney general or the inspector general is responsible for prosecuting the action as if the attorney general or the inspector general had intervened in accordance with section 4 of this chapter. 

(g) 
If the attorney general or inspector general shows that a specific discovery action by the person who initially filed the complaint will interfere with the investigation or prosecution of a 

civil or criminal matter arising out of the same facts, the court may, following a hearing in camera, stay discovery for not more than sixty 

(60) 
days. After the court has granted a sixty (60) day stay, the court may extend the stay, following a hearing in camera, if it determines that the state has pursued the civil or criminal investigation with reasonable diligence and that a specific discovery action by the person who initially filed the complaint will interfere with the state's investigation or prosecution of the civil or criminal matter. 


(h) A court may dismiss an action brought under this chapter to permit the attorney general or the inspector general to pursue its claim through an alternative proceeding, including an administrative proceeding or a proceeding brought in another jurisdiction. The person who initially filed the complaint has the same rights in the alternative proceedings as the person would have had in the original proceedings. A finding of fact or conclusion of law made in the alternative proceeding is binding on all parties to an action under this section once the determination made in the alternative proceeding is final under the rules, regulations, statutes, or law governing the alternative proceeding, or if the time for seeking an appeal or review of the determination made in the alternative proceeding has elapsed.

(1) 
any public contract has been regularly and lawfully executed and performed; or 

(2) 
any public work, building, or structure has been or is being performed, built, or constructed in accordance with the terms and provisions of the contract, and in compliance with the plans and specifications, if any. 


Upon a written petition of twenty-five (25) taxpayers, the state examiner may also require all plans, specifications, and estimates to be submitted to the state examiner for corrections and approval before a contract is awarded. 
(b) 
The state examiner, deputy examiner, and any field examiner, when engaged in making an inquiry, test, examination, or investigation under subsection (a), is entitled to examine and inspect any public records, documents, data, contracts, plans, and specifications contained or found in any public office or other place pertaining or relating to the public contract or public work, building, or structure. In addition, subpoenas may be issued to witnesses to appear before the examiner in person or to produce books and papers for inspection and examination. The state examiner, deputy, field, and private examiner may administer oaths and examine witnesses under oath either orally or by interrogatories on all matters under examination and investigation. Under order of the state examiner, the examination may be transcribed, with the reasonable expense paid by the municipality in the same manner as the compensation of the field examiner is paid.

(d) 
The state examiner, deputy examiner, any field examiner, and any private examiner, when making an examination or investigation under subsection (a), shall examine, inspect, and test the public works, buildings, or structures in the manner that the examiner sees fit to determine whether it is being performed, built, or constructed 

according to the contract and plans and specifications. 

(e) 
The state examiner shall file a report covering any examination or investigation that discloses: 

(1) 
fraud, collusion, misconduct, or negligence in the letting or the execution of any public contract or in the performance of any of the terms and conditions of any public contract; or

any failure to comply with the terms or conditions of any public contract in the construction of any public work, building, or structure or to perform, build, or construct it according to the plans and specifications, if any, provided in the contract; 




that causes loss, injury, waste, or damage to the state, the municipality, taxing or assessment district, other public entity, or to its citizens, if it is enforceable by assessment or taxation.

The suits may be brought in the name of the state on the relation of the attorney general for the benefit of the state, or the municipality, taxing or assessment district, or other public entity that may be proper. The actions brought against any defendants may be joined, as to parties, form, and causes of action, in the manner that the attorney general decides.

expense of the examination, investigation, or test shall be paid by the state upon vouchers approved by the state examiner from funds available for contractual service of the state board of accounts. If such a report shows misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in public office or shows that the terms of the plans and specifications under which a contract has been awarded are not being complied with, it is unlawful to make the report public until the report has been certified to the attorney general.

The attorney general may institute and prosecute civil proceedings against the delinquent officer or employee, or upon the officer's or employee's official bond, or both, and against any other proper person that will secure to the state or to the proper municipality the recovery of any funds misappropriated, diverted, or unaccounted for.
