IC 34-30-2 Chapter 2. Statutes Outside IC 34 That Confer Immunity 
IC 34-30-2-1 List of references; effect of listing and failure to list; exceptions 
Sec. 1. (a) This chapter contains a list of references to other immunity from civil liability provisions outside IC 34. 
(b) 
Listing in this chapter does not equate to the creation of an immunity from civil liability, and failure to be listed in this chapter does not negate an immunity from civil liability recognized elsewhere in the Indiana Code. 

(c) 
Many of the statutes granting immunity from civil liability also contain exceptions to the immunity granted. Therefore, each statute must be consulted directly to determine the extent of the immunity provided.
