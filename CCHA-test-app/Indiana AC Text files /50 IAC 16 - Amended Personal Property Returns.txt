The credit is reduced each time the credit is applied to the taxpayer's property taxes on personal property in succeeding years by the amount applied. 
(e) 
If an excess credit remains after the credit is applied in the final year to which the credit may be carried forward under subsection (d), the county auditor shall refund to the taxpayer the amount of any excess credit that remains after application of the credit under subsection (d) not later than December 31 of the final year to which the excess credit may be carried. 

(f) The taxpayer is not required to file an application for a credit under subsection (c) or (d) or a refund under subsection (e).
