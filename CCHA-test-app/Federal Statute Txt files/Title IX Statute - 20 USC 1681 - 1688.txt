Sec. 1682. Federal administrative enforcement; report to Congressional committees
Each Federal department and agency which is empowered to extend Federal financial assistance to any
education program or activity, by way of grant, loan, or contract other than a contract of insurance or guaranty,
is authorized and directed to effectuate the provisions of section 1681 of this title with respect to such program
or activity by issuing rules, regulations, or orders of general applicability which shall be consistent with
achievement of the objectives of the statute authorizing the financial assistance in connection with which the action
is taken. No such rule, regulation, or order shall become effective unless and until approved by the President.
Compliance with any requirement adopted pursuant to this section may be effected (1) by the termination of or
refusal to grant or to continue assistance under such program or activity to any recipient as to whom there has
been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with such requirement,
but such termination or refusal shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other recipient
as to whom such a finding has been made, and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part
thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found, or (2) by any other means authorized by law:
*Provided, however*, That no such action shall be taken until the department or agency concerned has advised
the appropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that
compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means. In the case of any action terminating, or refusing to grant or
continue, assistance because of failure to comply with a requirement imposed pursuant to this section, the head of
the Federal department or agency shall file with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative
jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for
such action. No such action shall become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.
