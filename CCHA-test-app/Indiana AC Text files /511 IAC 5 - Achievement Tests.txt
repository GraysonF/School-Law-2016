(c) 
The case conference committee must find and document that the following criteria are satisfied in order for the student to be assessed on alternate achievement standards: 

(1) 
There is empirical evidence of a significant cognitive disability that prevents the student from achieving Indiana's academic standards necessary to attain a high school diploma. Empirical evidence includes, but is not limited to, formal testing results and other evaluative data.

There are data to show that the student is unable to acquire, maintain, generalize, and apply academic skills across environments even with: 

(A) 
extensive;

intensive; 

(C) 
pervasive; 

(D) 
frequent; and

demonstrates that the student's present level of performance significantly impedes the student's participation in and completion of the general education curriculum even with significant program modifications. 





(d) 
The case conference committee's determination that the student will be assessed with ISTAR on alternate achievement standards cannot be based on factors other than cognitive functioning. Specifically, the case conference committee's determination may not be based on any of the following: 

(1) 
Excessive or extensive absences. 

(2) 
Social, cultural, or economic differences.
