(a) Base payments. The State shall
first award each agency described in
§ 301.30 the amount that agency would
have received under section 619 of the
Act for fiscal year 1997 if the State had
distributed 75 percent of its grant for
that year under section 619(c)(3), as
then in effect.
(b) Base payment adjustments. For fiscal year 1998 and beyond—
(1) If a new LEA is created, the State
shall divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (a) of this section for the LEAs that would have been
responsible for serving children with
disabilities now being served by the
new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3
through 5 currently provided special
education by each of the LEAs;
(2) If one or more LEAs are combined
into a single new LEA, the State shall
combine the base allocations of the
merged LEAs; and
(3) If for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative
responsibility for providing services to
children with disabilities ages 3
through 5 changes, the base allocations
of affected LEAs shall be redistributed
among affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 5 currently provided special education by each affected LEA.
(c) Allocation of remaining funds. After
making allocations under paragraph (a)
of this section, the State shall—
(1) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those agencies on the basis
of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary
and secondary schools within the agency’s jurisdiction; and
(2) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those agencies in accordance with their relative numbers
of children living in poverty, as determined by the SEA.
(3) For the purpose of making grants
under this section, States must apply
on a uniform basis across all LEAs the
best data that are available to them on
the numbers of children enrolled in
public and private elementary and sec-

Pt. 303

ondary schools and the numbers of
children living in poverty.
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(g)(1))

§ 301.32 Reallocation of local education agency funds.
(a) If a SEA determines that an LEA
is adequately providing a free appropriate public education to all children
with disabilities aged 3 through 5 residing in the area served by that agency
with State and local funds, the SEA
may reallocate any portion of the
funds under section 619 of the Act that
are not needed by that local agency to
provide a free appropriate public education to other local educational agencies in the State that are not adequately providing special education
and related services to all children
with disabilities aged 3 through 5 residing in the areas they serve.
(b) If a State provides services to preschool children with disabilities because some or all LEAs and ESAs are
unable or unwilling to provide appropriate programs, the SEA may use payments that would have been available
to those LEAs or ESAs to provide special education and related services to
children with disabilities aged 3
through 5 years, and to two-year-old
children with disabilities receiving
services consistent with § 301.1 who are
residing in the area served by those
LEAs and ESAs.

(i) Surgical in nature (such as cleft
palate surgery, surgery for club foot, or
the shunting of hydrocephalus); or
(ii) Purely medical in nature (such as

(3) Medical-health services (such as
immunizations and regular ‘‘wellbaby’’ care) that are routinely recommended for all children.

need early intervention services because they—
(1) Are experiencing developmental
delays, as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures,
in one or more of the following areas:
(i) Cognitive development.
(ii) Physical development, including
vision and hearing.
(iii) Communication development.
(iv) Social or emotional development.
(v) Adaptive development; or

early intervention services are not provided.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1432(4))
NOTE: The definition in this section distinguishes between the health services that are
required under this part and the medicalhealth services that are not required. The
IFSP requirements in subpart D of this part
provide that, to the extent appropriate,
these other medical-health services are to be
included in the IFSP, along with the funding
sources to be used in paying for the services
or the steps that will be taken to secure the
services through public or private sources.
Identifying these services in the IFSP does
not impose an obligation to provide the services if they are otherwise not required to be
provided under this part. (See § 303.344(e) and
the note 3 following that section.)

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1432(5))
NOTE 1: The phrase ‘‘a diagnosed physical
or mental condition that has a high probability of resulting in developmental delay,’’
as used in paragraph (a)(2) of this section,
applies to a condition if it typically results
in developmental delay. Examples of these
conditions include chromosomal abnormalities; genetic or congenital disorders; severe
sensory impairments, including hearing and
vision; inborn errors of metabolism; disorders reflecting disturbance of the development of the nervous system; congenital infections; disorders secondary to exposure to
toxic substances, including fetal alcohol syndrome; and severe attachment disorders.
NOTE 2: With respect to paragraph (b) of
this section, children who are at risk may be
eligible under this part if a State elects to
extend services to that population, even
though they have not been identified as disabled.
Under this provision, States have the authority to define who would be ‘‘at risk of
having substantial developmental delays if
early intervention services are not provided.’’ In defining the ‘‘at risk’’ population,
States may include well-known biological
and environmental factors that can be identified and that place infants and toddlers ‘‘at
risk’’ for developmental delay. Commonly
cited factors include low birth weight, respiratory distress as a newborn, lack of oxygen, brain hemorrhage, infection, nutritional
deprivation, and a history of abuse or neglect. It should be noted that ‘‘at risk’’ factors do not predict the presence of a barrier
to development, but they may indicate children who are at higher risk of developmental
delay than children without these problems.

§ 303.14 IFSP.
As used in this part, IFSP means the
individualized family service plan, as
that term is defined in § 303.340(b).

§ 303.123 Prohibition against commingling.
The statement must include an assurance satisfactory to the Secretary
that funds made available under this
part will not be commingled with State
funds.
(Approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under control number 1820–0550)
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1437(b)(5)(A))
NOTE: As used in this part, commingle
means depositing or recording funds in a
general account without the ability to identify each specific source of funds for any expenditure. Under that general definition, it
is clear that commingling is prohibited.
However, to the extent that the funds from
each of a series of Federal, State, local, and
private funding sources can be identified—
with a clear audit trail for each source—it is
appropriate for those funds to be consolidated for carrying out a common purpose. In
fact, a State may find it essential to set out
a funding plan that incorporates, and accounts for, all sources of funds that can be
targeted on a given activity or function related to the State’s early intervention program.
Thus, the assurance in this section is satisfied by the use of an accounting system that
includes an ‘‘audit trail’’ of the expenditure
of funds awarded under this part. Separate
bank accounts are not required.

(b) To meet the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section, the total

for children eligible under this part and
their families must be at least equal to
the total amount of State and local

(c) Annual meeting to evaluate the
IFSP. A meeting must be conducted on
at least an annual basis to evaluate the
IFSP for a child and the child’s family,
and, as appropriate, to revise its provisions. The results of any current evaluations conducted under § 303.322(c),
and other information available from
the ongoing assessment of the child
and family, must be used in determining what services are needed and
will be provided.
(d) Accessibility and convenience of
meetings. (1) IFSP meetings must be

NOTE: The requirement for the annual
evaluation incorporates the periodic review
process. Therefore, it is necessary to have
only one separate periodic review each year
(i.e., six months after the initial and subsequent annual IFSP meetings), unless conditions warrant otherwise.
Because the needs of infants and toddlers
change so rapidly during the course of a
year, certain evaluation procedures may
need to be repeated before conducting the
periodic reviews and annual evaluation
meetings in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this
section.

§ 303.344

§ 303.343 Participants in IFSP meetings and periodic reviews.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436(d))
NOTE 1: With respect to the requirements
in paragraph (d) of this section, the appropriate location of services for some infants
and toddlers might be a hospital setting—
during the period in which they require extensive medical intervention. However, for
these and other eligible children, early intervention services must be provided in natural
environments (e.g., the home, child care centers, or other community settings) to the
maximum extent appropriate to the needs of
the child.
NOTE 2: Throughout the process of developing and implementing IFSPs for an eligible child and the child’s family, it is important for agencies to recognize the variety of
roles that family members play in enhancing
the child’s development. It also is important
that the degree to which the needs of the
family are addressed in the IFSP process is
determined in a collaborative manner with
the full agreement and participation of the
parents of the child. Parents retain the ultimate decision in determining whether they,
their child, or other family members will accept or decline services under this part.
NOTE 3: The early intervention services in
paragraph (d) of this section are those services that a State is required to provide to a
child in accordance with § 303.12.
The ‘‘other services’’ in paragraph (e) of
this section are services that a child or family needs, but that are neither required nor
covered under this part. While listing the
non-required services in the IFSP does not
mean that those services must be provided,
their identification can be helpful to both
the child’s family and the service coordinator, for the following reasons: First, the
IFSP would provide a comprehensive picture
of the child’s total service needs (including
the need for medical and health services, as
well as early intervention services). Second,

§ 303.345

it is appropriate for the service coordinator
to assist the family in securing the non-required services (e.g., by (1) determining if
there is a public agency that could provide
financial assistance, if needed, (2) assisting
in the preparation of eligibility claims or insurance claims, if needed, and (3) assisting
the family in seeking out and arranging for
the child to receive the needed medicalhealth services).
Thus, to the extent appropriate, it is important for a State’s procedures under this
part to provide for ensuring that other needs
of the child, and of the family related to enhancing the development of the child, such
as medical and health needs, are considered
and addressed, including determining (1) who
will provide each service, and when, where,
and how it will be provided, and (2) how the
service will be paid for (e.g., through private
insurance, an existing Federal-State funding
source, such as Medicaid or EPSDT, or some
other funding arrangement).
NOTE 4: Although the IFSP must include
information about each of the items in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section, this
does not mean that the IFSP must be a detailed, lengthy document. It might be a brief
outline, with appropriate attachments that
address each of the points in the paragraphs
under this section. It is important for the
IFSP itself to be clear about (a) what services are to be provided, (b) the actions that
are to be taken by the service coordinator in
initiating those services, and (c) what actions will be taken by the parents.

§ 303.345 Provision of services before
evaluation and assessment are completed.
Early intervention services for an eligible child and the child’s family may
commence before the completion of the
evaluation and assessment in § 303.322,
if the following conditions are met:
(a) Parental consent is obtained.
(b) An interim IFSP is developed that
includes—
(1) The name of the service coordinator who will be responsible, consistent with § 303.344(g), for implementation of the interim IFSP and coordination with other agencies and persons; and
(2) The early intervention services
that have been determined to be needed
immediately by the child and the
child’s family.

(Approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under control number 1820–0550)
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1436(c))
NOTE: This section is intended to accomplish two specific purposes: (1) To facilitate
the provision of services in the event that a
child has obvious immediate needs that are
identified, even at the time of referral (e.g.,
a physician recommends that a child with
cerebral palsy begin receiving physical therapy as soon as possible), and (2) to ensure
that the requirements for the timely evaluation and assessment are not circumvented.

§ 303.346 Responsibility and accountability.
Each agency or person who has a direct role in the provision of early intervention services is responsible for making a good faith effort to assist each eligible child in achieving the outcomes
in the child’s IFSP. However, part C of
the Act does not require that any agency or person be held accountable if an
eligible child does not achieve the
growth projected in the child’s IFSP.
(Approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under control number 1820–0550)

(i) Understanding the basic components of early intervention services
available in the State;
(ii) Meeting the interrelated social or
emotional, health, developmental, and
educational needs of eligible children
under this part; and
(iii) Assisting families in enhancing
the development of their children, and
in participating fully in the development and implementation of IFSPs.
(c) A personnel development system
under this part may include—
(1) Implementing innovative strategies and activities for the recruitment
and retention of early intervention
service providers;
(2) Promoting the preparation of
early intervention providers who are
fully and appropriately qualified to
provide early intervention services
under this part;
(3) Training personnel to work in
rural and inner-city areas; and
(4) Training personnel to coordinate
transition services for infants and toddlers with disabilities from an early
intervention program under this part
to a preschool program under part B of
the Act or to other preschool or other
appropriate services.

PERSONNEL TRAINING AND STANDARDS
§ 303.360 Comprehensive system of
personnel development.
(a) Each system must include a comprehensive system of personnel development.
(b) The personnel development system under this part must—
(1) Be consistent with the comprehensive system of personnel development required under part B of the
Act (34 CFR 300.380 through 300.387);
(2) Provide for preservice and inservice training to be conducted on an
interdisciplinary basis, to the extent
appropriate;
(3) Provide for the training of a variety of personnel needed to meet the requirements of this part, including public and private providers, primary referral sources, paraprofessionals, and
persons who will serve as service coordinators; and
(4) Ensure that the training provided
relates specifically to—

(b)(1) Each statewide system must
have policies and procedures relating
to the establishment and maintenance
of standards to ensure that personnel
necessary to carry out the purposes of
this part are appropriately and adequately prepared and trained.
(2) The policies and procedures required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must provide for the establishment and maintenance of standards
that are consistent with any State-approved or State-recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other
comparable requirements that apply to
the profession or discipline in which a
person is providing early intervention
services.
(c) To the extent that a State’s
standards for a profession or discipline,
including standards for temporary or
emergency certification, are not based
on the highest requirements in the
State applicable to a specific profession or discipline, the State’s application for assistance under this part
must include the steps the State is
taking, the procedures for notifying
public agencies and personnel of those
steps, and the timelines it has established for the retraining or hiring of
personnel that meet appropriate professional requirements in the State.
(d)(1) In meeting the requirements in
paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a
determination must be made about the
status of personnel standards in the

§ 303.361

State. That determination must be
based on current information that accurately describes, for each profession
or discipline in which personnel are
providing early intervention services,
whether the applicable standards are
consistent with the highest requirements in the State for that profession
or discipline.
(2) The information required in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be on
file in the lead agency, and available to
the public.
(e) In identifying the ‘‘highest requirements in the State’’ for purposes
of this section, the requirements of all
State statutes and the rules of all
State agencies applicable to serving
children eligible under this part and
their families must be considered.
(f) A State may allow paraprofessionals and assistants who are appropriately trained and supervised, in accordance with State law, regulations,
or written policy, to assist in the provision of early intervention services to
eligible children under this part.
(g) In implementing this section, a
State may adopt a policy that includes
making ongoing good-faith efforts to
recruit and hire appropriately and adequately trained personnel to provide
early intervention services to eligible
children, including, in a geographic
area of the State where there is a
shortage of personnel that meet these
qualifications, the most qualified individuals available who are making satisfactory progress toward completing
applicable course work necessary to
meet the standards described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, consistent
with State law, within 3 years.

NOTE: This section requires that a State
use its own existing highest requirements to
determine the standards appropriate to personnel who provide early intervention services under this part. The regulations do not
require States to set any specified training
standard, such as a master’s degree, for employment of personnel who provide services
under this part.
The regulations permit each State to determine the specific occupational categories
required to provide early intervention services to children eligible under this part and
their families, and to revise or expand these

MEDIATION AND DUE PROCESS PROCEDURES FOR PARENTS AND CHILDREN
§ 303.419 Mediation.
(a) General. Each State shall ensure
that procedures are established and implemented to allow parties to disputes
involving any matter described in
§ 303.403(a) to resolve the disputes
through a mediation process which, at
a minimum, must be available whenever a hearing is requested under
§ 303.420. The lead agency may either
use the mediation system established
under Part B of the Act or establish its
own system.
(b) Requirements. The procedures
must meet the following requirements:
(1) The procedures must ensure that
the mediation process—
(i) Is voluntary on the part of the
parties;
(ii) Is not used to deny or delay a parent’s right to a due process hearing
under § 303.420, or to deny any other
rights afforded under Part C of the Act;
and
(iii) Is conducted by a qualified and
impartial mediator who is trained in
effective mediation techniques.
(2) The State shall maintain a list of
individuals who are qualified mediators
and knowledgeable in laws and regulations relating to the provision of special education and related services.
(3) The State shall bear the cost of
the mediation process, including the

costs of meetings described in paragraph (c) of this section.
(4) Each session in the mediation
process must be scheduled in a timely
manner and must be held in a location
that is convenient to the parties to the
dispute.
(5) An agreement reached by the parties to the dispute in the mediation
process must be set forth in a written
mediation agreement.
(6) Discussions that occur during the
mediation process must be confidential
and may not be used as evidence in any
subsequent due process hearings or
civil proceedings, and the parties to
the mediation process may be required
to sign a confidentiality pledge prior to
the commencement of the process.
(c) Meeting to encourage mediation. A
State may establish procedures to require parents who elect not to use the
mediation process to meet, at a time
and location convenient to the parents,
with a disinterested party—
(1) Who is under contract with a parent training and information center or
community parent resource center in
the State established under sections
682 or 683 of the Act, or an appropriate
alternative dispute resolution entity;
and
(2) Who would explain the benefits of
the mediation process and encourage
the parents to use the process.

a complaint.
(Approved by the Office of Management and

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(1))
NOTE 1: Sections 303.420 through 303.425 are
concerned with the adoption of impartial
procedures for resolving individual child
complaints (i.e., complaints that generally
affect only a single child or the child’s family). These procedures require the appointment of a decision-maker who is impartial,
as defined in § 303.421(b), to resolve a dispute
concerning any of the matters in § 303.403(a).
The decision of the impartial decision-maker
is binding unless it is reversed on appeal.
A different type of administrative procedure is included in §§ 303.510 through 303.512
of subpart F of this part. Under those procedures, the lead agency is responsible for (1)
investigating any complaint that it receives
(including individual child complaints and
those that are systemic in nature), and (2)
resolving the complaint if the agency determines that a violation has occurred.
NOTE 2: It is important that the administrative procedures developed by a State be
designed to result in speedy resolution of
complaints. An infant’s or toddler’s development is so rapid that undue delay could be
potentially harmful.

§ 303.421 Appointment of an impartial
person.
(a) Qualifications and duties. An impartial person must be appointed to
implement the complaint resolution
process in this subpart. The person
must—
(1) Have knowledge about the provisions of this part and the needs of, and
services available for, eligible children
and their families; and
(2) Perform the following duties:
(i) Listen to the presentation of relevant viewpoints about the complaint,
examine all information relevant to
the issues, and seek to reach a timely
resolution of the complaint.
(ii) Provide a record of the proceedings, including a written decision.
(b) Definition of impartial. (1) As used
in this section, impartial means that
the person appointed to implement the
complaint resolution process—
(i) Is not an employee of any agency
or other entity involved in the provision of early intervention services or
care of the child; and

§ 303.423

(ii) Does not have a personal or professional interest that would conflict
with his or her objectivity in implementing the process.
(2) A person who otherwise qualifies
under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is
not an employee of an agency solely
because the person is paid by the agency to implement the complaint resolution process.

rights in paragraph (b) of this section
in any administrative proceedings carried out under § 303.420.
(b) Rights. Any parent involved in an
administrative proceeding has the
right to—
(1) Be accompanied and advised by
counsel and by individuals with special
knowledge or training with respect to
early intervention services for children
eligible under this part;
(2) Present evidence and confront,

(Approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under control number 1820–0550)
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(1))
NOTE: Under part B of the Act, States are
allowed 45 days to conduct an impartial due
process hearing (i.e., within 45 days after the
receipt of a request for a hearing, a decision
is reached and a copy of the decision is
mailed to each of the parties). (See 34 CFR
300.512.) Thus, if a State, in meeting the requirements of § 303.420, elects to adopt the
due process procedures under part B, that
State would also have 45 days for hearings.
However, any State in that situation is encouraged (but not required) to accelerate the
timeline for the due process hearing for children who are eligible under this part—from
45 days to the 30-day timeline in this section.
Because the needs of children in the birththrough-two-age range change so rapidly,
quick resolution of complaints is important.

Any party aggrieved by the findings
and decision regarding an administrative complaint has the right to bring a
civil action in State or Federal court

will follow in order to ensure the protection of any personally identifiable
information collected, used, or maintained under this part, including the
right of parents to written notice of
and written consent to the exchange of
this information among agencies consistent with Federal and State law.
(b) These policies and procedures
must meet the requirements in 34 CFR
300.560 through 300.576, with the modifications specified in § 303.5(b).
(Approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under control number 1820–0550)
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1439(a)(2), 1442)
NOTE: With the modifications referred to in
paragraph (b) of this section, the confidentiality requirements in the regulations implementing part B of the Act (34 CFR 300.560
through 300.576) are to be used by public
agencies to meet the confidentiality requirements under part C of the Act and this section (§ 303.460).
The part B provisions incorporate by reference the regulations in 34 CFR part 99
(Family Educational Rights and Privacy);
therefore, those regulations also apply to
this part.

(1) Meet the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; and
(2) Be reflected in the interagency
agreements required in § 303.523.
(b) Specific funding policies. A State’s
policies must—

(i) Fees will not be charged for the
services that a child is otherwise entitled to receive at no cost to parents;
and
(ii) The inability of the parents of an

not result in the denial of services to
the child or the child’s family; and
(4) Set out any fees that will be
charged for early intervention services
and the basis for those fees.
(c) Procedures to ensure the timely provision of services. No later than the beginning of the fifth year of a State’s

§ 303.527

Payor of last resort.

(a) Nonsubstitution of funds. Except as
provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, funds under this part may not be
used to satisfy a financial commitment
for services that would otherwise have
been paid for from another public or
private source, including any medical
program administered by the Secretary
of Defense, but for the enactment of
part C of the Act. Therefore, funds
under this part may be used only for
early intervention services that an eligible child needs but is not currently
entitled to under any other Federal,
State, local, or private source.
(b) Interim payments—reimbursement.
(1) If necessary to prevent a delay in
the timely provision of services to an
eligible child or the child’s family,
funds under this part may be used to
pay the provider of services, pending
reimbursement from the agency or entity that has ultimate responsibility
for the payment.
(2) Payments under paragraph (b)(1)
of this section may be made for—
(i) Early intervention services, as described in § 303.12;
(ii) Eligible health services (see
§ 303.13); and
(iii) Other functions and services authorized under this part, including
child find and evaluation and assessment.
(3) The provisions of paragraph (b)(1)
of this section do not apply to medical
services or ‘‘well-baby’’ health care
(see § 303.13(c)(1)).
(c) Non-reduction of benefits. Nothing
in this part may be construed to permit a State to reduce medical or other
assistance available or to alter eligi-

bility under title V of the Social Security Act (SSA) (relating to maternal
and child health) or title XIX of the
SSA (relating to Medicaid for children
eligible under this part) within the
State.
(Approved by the Office of Management and
Budget under control number 1820–0550)
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1440)
NOTE: The Congress intended that the enactment of part C not be construed as a license to any agency (including the lead
agency and other agencies in the State) to
withdraw funding for services that currently
are or would be made available to eligible
children but for the existence of the program
under this part. Thus, the Congress intended
that other funding sources would continue,
and that there would be greater coordination
among agencies regarding the payment of
costs.
The Congress further clarified its intent
concerning payments under Medicaid by including in section 411(k)(13) of the Medicare
Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L.
100–360) an amendment to title XIX of the
Social Security Act. That amendment
states, in effect, that nothing in this title
shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting, or authorizing the Secretary of Health
and Human Services to prohibit or restrict,
payment under subsection (a) of section 1903
of the Social Security Act for medical assistance for covered services furnished to an infant or toddler with a disability because
those services are included in the child’s
IFSP adopted pursuant to part C of the Act.
