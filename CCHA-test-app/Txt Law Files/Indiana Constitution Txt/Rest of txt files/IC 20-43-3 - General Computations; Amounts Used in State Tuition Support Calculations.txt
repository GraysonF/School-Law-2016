IC 20-43-3-4 Calculation; previous year revenue 
Sec. 4. (a) This subsection applies to the determination of a school corporation's previous year's revenue for purposes of determining distributions under this article. A school corporation's previous year revenue equals the amount determined using the following formula: 
STEP ONE: Determine the school corporation's basic tuition support actually received for the state fiscal year that immediately precedes the current state fiscal year. STEP TWO: Subtract from the STEP ONE result an amount equal to the reduction in the school corporation's state tuition support under any combination of subsection (b) or IC 20-30-2-4. 
(b) A school corporation's previous year revenue must be reduced if: 
(1) the school corporation's state tuition support for special 
 education or career and technical education is reduced as a result of a complaint being filed with the department after December 31, 1988, because the school program overstated the number of children enrolled in special education programs or career and technical education programs; and 
(2) the school corporation's previous year revenue has not been reduced under this subsection more than one (1) time because of a given overstatement. 
The amount of the reduction equals the amount the school corporation would have received in state tuition support for special education and career and technical education because of the overstatement.

IC 20-43-3-7 Count adjustments and distribution adjustments 
Sec. 7. (a) This section applies to distributions under this article that are computed in any part based on a count of students under IC 20-43-4-2. 
(b) If the state board subsequently adjusts under IC 20-43-4-2 a count used for a distribution under this article, the department shall adjust subsequent distributions to the school corporation that are affected by the adjusted count, on the schedule determined by the department, to reflect the differences between the distribution that the school corporation received and the distribution that the school corporation would have received if the adjusted count had been used.
