If a student is required to take an exam under subsection (a), the appropriate school official shall make a determination based on the guidelines and thresholds established in section 2 of this chapter as to whether the student is in need of additional instruction or remedial action with respect to a particular subject matter covered in the exam. If the appropriate school official determines that a student who takes an exam under subsection (a) is in need of remediation or supplemental instruction to prevent the need for remediation at a postsecondary educational institution or workforce development program, the appropriate school official shall inform the student's parent: 

(1) 
of the likelihood that the student will require remedial course work; 

(2) 
of the potential financial impact on the student or the parent for the additional remedial course work described in subdivision (1), including that the student may not be eligible to receive state scholarships, grants, or assistance administered by the commission for higher education; and 



(3) 
of the additional time that may be required to earn a degree; while the student attends a postsecondary educational institution or workforce development program. The appropriate secondary school official may establish a remediation or supplemental instruction plan with the student's parent.

under this section, the student may enroll in a dual credit course under IC 21-43. The cost of the administration of the exam under this subsection and subsection (d) shall be paid by the department.

A student who takes an exam under subsection (a) and is identified as being in need of remediation or supplemental instruction shall retake the college and career readiness exam during grade 12 after a remediation or supplemental instruction plan is completed.
