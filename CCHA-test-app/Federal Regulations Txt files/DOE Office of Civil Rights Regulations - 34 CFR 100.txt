§ 100.3

§ 100.1 Purpose.
The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the ‘‘Act’’) to the end that
no person in the United States shall;
on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance
from the Department of Education.
(Authority: Sec. 601, Civil Rights Act of 1964;
78 Stat. 252; 42 U.S.C. 2000d)

§ 100.2 Application of this regulation.
This regulation applies to any program to which Federal financial assistance is authorized to be extended to a
recipient under a law administered by

financial assistance listed in appendix
A of this regulation. It applies to
money paid, property transferred, or

Discrimination prohibited.

color, or national origin be excluded
from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be otherwise subjected
to discrimination under any program
to which this part applies.
(b) Specific discriminatory actions prohibited. (1) A recipient under any program to which this part applies may
not, directly or through contractual or
other arrangements, on ground of race,
color, or national origin:
(i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided
under the program;
(ii) Provide any service, financial aid,
or other benefit to an individual which
is different, or is provided in a different
manner, from that provided to others
under the program;
(iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to his receipt of any service,

(iv) Restrict an individual in any way
in the enjoyment of any advantage or
privilege enjoyed by others receiving
any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;
(v) Treat an individual differently
from others in determining whether he
satisfies any admission, enrollment,
quota, eligibility, membership or other
requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or
other benefit provided under the program;
(vi) Deny an individual an opportunity to participate in the program
through the provision of services or
otherwise or afford him an opportunity
to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program (including the opportunity to participate
in the program as an employee but
only to the extent set forth in paragraph (c) of this section).
(vii) Deny a person the opportunity
to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.
(2) A recipient, in determining the
types of services, financial aid, or other
benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the
class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities
will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be
afforded an opportunity to participate
in any such program, may not, directly
or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods
of administration which have the effect
of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the
program as respect individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.
(3) In determining the site or location of a facilities, an applicant or recipient may not make selections with
the effect of excluding individuals
from, denying them the benefits of, or
subjecting them to discrimination
under any programs to which this regulation applies, on the ground of race,
color, or national origin; or with the
purpose or effect of defeating or sub-

stantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or
this regulation.
(4) As used in this section, the services, financial aid, or other benefits
provided under a program receiving
Federal financial assistance shall be
deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefits provided in
or through a facility provided with the
aid of Federal financial assistance.
(5) The enumeration of specific forms
of prohibited discrimination in this
paragraph and paragraph (c) of this
section does not limit the generality of
the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this
section.
(6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons
on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take
affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.
(ii) Even in the absence of such prior
discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of
conditions which resulted in limiting
participation by persons of a particular
race, color, or national origin.
(c) Employment practices. (1) Where a
primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which
this regulation applies is to provide
employment, a recipient may not (directly or through contractual or other
arrangements) subject an individual to
discrimination on the ground of race,
color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities), including programs where a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance
is (i) to reduce the employment of such
individuals or to help them through
employment to meet subsistence needs,
(ii) to assist such individuals through
employment to meet expenses incident
to the commencement or continuation
of their education or training, (iii) to
provide work experience which contributes to the education or training of

such individuals, or (iv) to provide remunerative activity to such individuals who because of handicaps cannot
be readily absorbed in the competitive
labor market. The following, under existing laws, have one of the above objectives as a primary objective:
(A) Projects under the Public Works
Acceleration Act, Pub. L. 87–658, 42
U.S.C. 2641–2643.
(B) Work-study under the Vocational
Education Act of 1963, as amended, 20
U.S.C. 1371–1374.
(C) Programs assisted under laws
listed in appendix A as respects employment opportunities provided thereunder, or in facilities provided thereunder, which are limited, or for which
preference is given, to students, fellows, or other persons in training for
the same or related employments.
(D) Assistance to rehabilitation facilities under the Vocational Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. 32–34, 41a and 41b.
(2) The requirements applicable to
construction employment under any
such program shall be those specified
in or pursuant to Part III of Executive
Order 11246 or any Executive order
which supersedes it.
(3) Where a primary objective of the
Federal financial assistance is not to
provide employment, but discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in the employment practices of the recipient or other persons
subject to the regulation tends, on the
ground of race, color, or national origin, to exclude individuals from participation in, to deny them the benefits
of, or to subject them to discrimination under any program to which this
regulation applies, the foregoing provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply
to the employment practices of the recipient or other persons subject to the
regulation, to the extent necessary to
assure equality of opportunity to, and
nondiscriminatory treatment of, beneficiaries.
(d) Indian health and Cuban refugee
services. An individual shall not be
deemed subjected to discrimination by
reason of his exclusion from benefits
limited by Federal law to individuals
of a particular race, color, or national
origin different from his.
(e) Medical emergencies. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of

this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be deemed
to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if immediate
provision of a service or other benefit
to an individual is necessary to prevent
his death or serious impairment of his
health, and such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or
through a medical institution which
refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.
(Authority: Sec. 601, 602, 604, Civil Rights Act

§ 100.4 Assurances required.
(a) General. (1) Every application for
Federal financial assistance to which
this part applies, except an application
to which paragraph (b) of this section
applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a
facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to
the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility
operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to
this part. In the case of an application
for Federal financial assistance to provide real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent
transfer, the transferee, for the period
during which the real property or
structures are used for a purpose for
which the Federal financial assistance
is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case of personal
property the assurance shall obligate
the recipient for the period during
which he retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases
the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal
financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The responsible
Department official shall specify the
form of the foregoing assurances, and
the extent to which like assurances
will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other

participants. Any such assurance shall
include provisions which give the
United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.
(2) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of a transfer of real property or interest therein
from the Federal Government the instrument effecting or recording the
transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during
which the real property is used for a
purpose for which the Federal financial
assistance is extended or for another
purpose involving the provision of
similar services or benefits. Where no
transfer of property is involved but
property is improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall
agree to include such a covenant to
any subsequent transfer of the property. Where the property is obtained
from the Federal Government, such
covenant may also include a condition
coupled with a right to be reserved by
the Department to revert title to the
property in the event of a breach of the
covenant where, in the discretion of
the responsible Department official,
such a condition and right of reverter
is appropriate to the statute under
which the real property is obtained and
to the nature of the grant and the
grantee. In the event a transferee of
real property proposes to mortgage or
otherwise encumber the real property
as security for financing construction
of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on such property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the responsible Department official may agree, upon request of the
transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing, and upon such
conditions as he deems appropriate, to
forbear the exercise of such right to revert title for so long as the lien of such
mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.
(b) Continuing Federal financial assistance. Every application by a State or a
State agency for continuing Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies (including the Federal financial assistance listed in part 2 of
appendix A) shall as a condition to its
approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to

the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the
program is (or, in the case of a new
program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by
or pursuant to this regulation, and (2)
provide or be accompanied by provision
for such methods of administration for
the program as are found by the responsible Department official to give
reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program
will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this regulation.
(c) Elementary and secondary schools.
The requirements of paragraph (a) or
(b) of this section with respect to any
elementary or secondary school or
school system shall be deemed to be
satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a
court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school
system, and provides an assurance that
it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such
order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school
system which the responsible Department official determines is adequate to
accomplish the purposes of the Act and
this part, at the earliest practicable
time, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan; in
any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the responsible Department official may reserve the right to
redetermine, after such period as may
be specified by him, the adequacy of
the plan to accomplish the purposes of
the Act and the regulations in this
part. In any case in which a final order
of a court of the United States for the
desegregation of such school or school
system is entered after submission of
such a plan, such plan shall be revised
to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such
order.
(d) Assurance from institutions. (1) In

financial assistance to an institution of
higher education (including assistance
for construction, for research, for special training project, for student loans

or for any other purpose), the assurance required by this section shall extend to admission practices and to all
other practices relating to the treatment of students.
(2) The assurance required with respect to an institution of higher education, hospital, or any other institution, insofar as the assurance relates to
the institution’s practices with respect

of services or other benefits to such individuals, shall be applicable to the entire institution.

[45 FR 30918, May 9, 1980, as amended at 65
FR 68053, Nov. 13, 2000]

§ 100.5 Illustrative application.
The following examples will illustrate the programs aided by Federal financial assistance of the Department.
(In all cases the discrimination prohibited is discrimination on the ground of
race, color, or national origin prohibited by title VI of the Act and this regulation, as a condition of the receipt of
Federal financial assistance).
(a) In federally-affected area assistance (Pub. L. 815 and Pub. L. 874) for
construction aid and for general support of the operation of elementary or
secondary schools, or in more limited
support to such schools such as for the
acquisition of equipment, the provision
of vocational education, or the provision of guidance and counseling services, discrimination by the recipient
school district in any of its elementary
or secondary schools in the admission
of students, or in the treatment of its
students in any aspect of the educational process, is prohibited. In this
and the following illustrations the prohibition of discrimination in the treatment of students or other trainees includes the prohibition of discrimination among the students or trainees in
the availability or use of any academic, dormitory, eating, recreational,
or other facilities of the grantee or
other recipient.
(b) In a research, training, demonstration, or other grant to a univer-

sity for activities to be conducted in a
graduate school, discrimination in the
admission and treatment of students in
the graduate school is prohibited, and
the prohibition extends to the entire
university.
(c) In a training grant to a hospital
or other nonacademic institution, discrimination is prohibited in the selection of individuals to be trained and in
their treatment by the grantee during
their training. In a research or demonstration grant to such an institution
discrimination is prohibited with respect to any educational activity and
any provision of medical or other services and any financial aid to individuals incident to the program.
(d) In grants to assist in the construction of facilities for the provision
of health, educational or welfare services, assurances will be required that
services will be provided without discrimination, to the same extent that
discrimination would be prohibited as a
condition of Federal operating grants
for the support of such services. Thus,
as a condition of grants for the construction of academic, research, or
other facilities at institutions of higher education, assurances will be required that there will be no discrimination in the admission or treatment of
students.
(e) Upon transfers of real or personal
surplus property for educational uses,
discrimination is prohibited to the
same extent as in the case of grants for
the construction of facilities or the
provision of equipment for like purposes.
(f) Each applicant for a grant for the
construction of educational television
facilities is required to provide an assurance that it will, in its broadcast
services, give due consideration to the
interests of all significant racial or
ethnic groups within the population to
be served by the applicant.
(g) A recipient may not take action
that is calculated to bring about indirectly what this regulation forbids it
to accomplish directly. Thus, a State,
in selecting or approving projects or
sites for the construction of public libraries which will receive Federal financial assistance, may not base its selections or approvals on criteria which

have the effect of defeating or of substantially impairing accomplishments
of the objectives of the Federal assistance as respects individuals of a particular race, color or national origin.
(h) In some situations, even though
past discriminatory practices attributable to a recipient or applicant have
been abandoned, the consequences of
such practices continue to impede the
full availability of a benefit. If the efforts required of the applicant or recipient under § 100.6(d), to provide information as to the availability of the
program or activity and the rights of
beneficiaries under this regulation,
have failed to overcome these consequences, it will become necessary
under the requirement stated in paragraph (i) of § 100.3(b)(6) for such applicant or recipient to take additional
steps to make the benefits fully available to racial and nationality groups
previously subject to discrimination.
This action might take the form, for
example, of special arrangements for
obtaining referrals or making selections which will insure that groups previously subjected to discrimination are
adequately served.
(i) Even though an applicant or recipient has never used discriminatory
policies, the services and benefits of
the program or activity it administers
may not in fact be equally available to
some racial or nationality groups. In
such circumstances, an applicant or recipient may properly give special consideration to race, color, or national
origin to make the benefits of its program more widely available to such
groups, not then being adequately
served. For example, where a university is not adequately serving members
of a particular racial or nationality
group, it may establish special recruitment policies to make its program better known and more readily available
to such group, and take other steps to
provide that group with more adequate
service.

1964; 78 Stat. 252; 42 U.S.C. 2000d, 2000d–1)

FR 68053, Nov. 13, 2000]

§ 100.6 Compliance information.
(a) Cooperation and assistance. The responsible Department official shall to

the fullest extent practicable seek the
cooperation of recipients in obtaining
compliance with this part and shall
provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.
(b) Compliance reports. Each recipient
shall keep such records and submit to
the responsible Department official or
his designee timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such
times, and in such form and containing
such information, as the responsible
Department official or his designee
may determine to be necessary to enable him to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying
with this part. For example, recipients
should have available for the Department racial and ethnic data showing
the extent to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of and participants in federally-assisted programs. In the case in which a primary
recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such
other recipient shall also submit such
compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable
the primary recipient to carry out its
obligations under this part.
(c) Access to sources of information.
Each recipient shall permit access by
the responsible Department official or
his designee during normal business
hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this
part. Where any information required
of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or
person and this agency, institution or
person shall fail or refuse to furnish
this information the recipient shall so
certify in its report and shall set forth
what efforts it has made to obtain the
information. Asserted considerations of
privacy or confidentiality may not operate to bar the Department from evaluating or seeking to enforce compliance with this part. Information of a
confidential nature obtained in connection with compliance evaluation or enforcement shall not be disclosed except
where necessary in formal enforcement
proceedings or where otherwise required by law.

(d) Information to beneficiaries and
participants. Each recipient shall make
available to participants, beneficiaries,
and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of
this regulation and its applicability to
the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and
make such information available to
them in such manner, as the responsible Department official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the

§ 100.7

Conduct of investigations.

(a) Periodic compliance reviews. The responsible Department official or his
designee shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying
with this part.
(b) Complaints. Any person who believes himself or any specific class of
individuals to be subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may by
himself or by a representative file with
the responsible Department official or
his designee a written complaint. A
complaint must be filed not later than
180 days from the date of the alleged
discrimination, unless the time for filing is extended by the responsible Department official or his designee.
(c) Investigations. The responsible Department official or his designee will
make a prompt investigation whenever
a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with
this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of
the pertinent practices and policies of
the recipient, the circumstances under
which the possible noncompliance with
this part occurred, and other factors
relevant to a determination as to
whether the recipient has failed to
comply with this part.

has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner
in an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this part. The identity of
complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to
carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding

with this regulation, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal

and (2) any applicable proceeding under
State or local law.
(b) Noncompliance with § 100.4. If an
applicant fails or refuses to furnish an
assurance required under § 100.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a
requirement imposed by or pursuant to
that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with
the procedures of paragraph (c) of this
section. The Department shall not be
required to provide assistance in such a
case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that the Department
shall continue assistance during the
pendency of such proceedings where
such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of
this part.
(c) Termination of or refusal to grant or
to continue Federal financial assistance.
No order suspending, terminating or
refusing to grant or continue Federal
financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible Department official has advised the applicant
or recipient of his failure to comply
and has determined that compliance
cannot be secured by voluntary means,
(2) there has been an express finding on
the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement
imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3)
the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committee of
the House and the committee of the
Senate having legislative jurisdiction
over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the
grounds for such action. Any action to
suspend or terminate or to refuse to
grant or to continue Federal financial
assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof,
or other applicant or recipient as to
whom such a finding has been made
and shall be limited in its effect to the
particular program, or part thereof, in
which such noncompliance has been so
found.
(d) Other means authorized by law. No
action to effect compliance by any
other means authorized by law shall be
taken until (1) the responsible Department official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary

means, (2) the recipient or other person
has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration
of at least 10 days from the mailing of
such notice to the recipient or other
person. During this period of at least 10
days additional efforts shall be made to
persuade the recipient or other person
to comply with the regulation and to
take such corrective action as may be
appropriate.
(Authority: Sec. 601, 602, Civil Rights Act of
1964; 78 Stat. 252; 42 U.S.C. 2000d, 2000d–1. Sec.

§ 100.9 Hearings.
(a) Opportunity for hearing. Whenever
an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 100.8(c), reasonable notice
shall be given by registered or certified
mail, return receipt requested, to the
affected applicant or recipient. This
notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be
taken, the specific provision under
which the proposed action against it is
to be taken, and the matters of fact or
law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less
than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible
Department official that the matter be
scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the
applicant or recipient that the matter
in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The
time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for
cause. The complainant, if any, shall
be advised of the time and place of the
hearing. An applicant or recipient may
waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record.
The failure of an applicant or recipient
to request a hearing for which a date
has been set shall be deemed to be a
waiver of the right to a hearing under
section 602 of the Act and § 100.8(c) of
this regulation and consent to the
making of a decision on the basis of
such information as may be filed as the
record.
(b) Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices of the
Department in Washington, DC, at a
time fixed by the responsible Department official unless he determines that

§ 100.10

the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Department requires
that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before a hearing examiner designated in accordance with 5
U.S.C. 3105 and 3344 (section 11 of the
Administrative Procedure Act).
(c) Right to counsel. In all proceedings
under this section, the applicant or recipient and the Department shall have
the right to be represented by counsel.
(d) Procedures, evidence, and record. (1)
The hearing, decision, and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with sections 5–8
of the Administrative Procedure Act,
and in accordance with such rules of
procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to
the conduct of the hearing, giving of
notices subsequent to those provided
for in paragraph (a) of this section,
taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings,
and other related matters. Both the
Department and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce
all relevant evidence on the issues as
stated in the notice for hearing or as
determined by the officer conducting
the hearing at the outset of or during
the hearing. Any person (other than a
Government employee considered to be
on official business) who, having been
invited or requested to appear and testify as a witness on the Government’s
behalf, attends at a time and place
scheduled for a hearing provided for by
this part, may be reimbursed for his
travel and actual expenses of attendance in an amount not to exceed the
amount payable under the standardized
travel regulations to a Government
employee traveling on official business.
(2) Technical rules of evidence shall
not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles
designed to assure production of the
most credible evidence available and to
subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All
documents and other evidence offered
or taken for the record shall be open to
examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts

and arguments advanced on either side
of the issues. A transcript shall be
made of the oral evidence except to the
extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall
be based upon the hearing record and
written findings shall be made.
(e) Consolidated or joint hearings. In
cases in which the same or related
facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this regulation with
respect to two or more Federal assistance statutes to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part
and the regulations of one or more
other Federal departments or agencies
issued under title VI of the Act, the responsible Department official may, by
agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable,
provide for the conduct of consolidated
or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this part.
Final decisions in such cases, insofar as
this regulation is concerned, shall be
made in accordance with § 100.10.

§ 100.10 Decisions and notices.
(a) Decisions by hearing examiners.
After a hearing is held by a hearing examiner such hearing examiner shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record
including his recommended findings
and proposed decision to the reviewing
authority for a final decision, and a
copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant
or recipient and to the complainant, if
any. Where the initial decision referred
to in this paragraph or in paragraph (c)
of this section is made by the hearing
examiner, the applicant or recipient or
the counsel for the Department may,
within the period provided for in the
rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official, file with the
reviewing authority exceptions to the
initial decision, with his reasons therefor. Upon the filing of such exceptions
the reviewing authority shall review
the initial decision and issue its own
decision thereof including the reasons
therefor. In the absence of exceptions

34 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)

the initial decision shall constitute the
final decision, subject to the provisions
of paragraph (e) of this section.
(b) Decisions on record or review by the
reviewing authority. Whenever a record
is certified to the reviewing authority
for decision or it reviews the decision
of a hearing examiner pursuant to
paragraph (a) or (c) of this section, the
applicant or recipient shall be given
reasonable opportunity to file with it
briefs or other written statements of
its contentions, and a copy of the final
decision of the reviewing authority
shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.
(c) Decisions on record where a hearing
is waived. Whenever a hearing is waived
pursuant to § 100.9(a) the reviewing authority shall make its final decision on
the record or refer the matter to a
hearing examiner for an initial decision to be made on the record. A copy
of such decision shall be given in writing to the applicant or recipient, and
to the complainant, if any.
(d) Rulings required. Each decision of
a hearing examiner or reviewing authority shall set forth a ruling on each
finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirement or requirements imposed by or
pursuant to this part with which it is
found that the applicant or recipient
has failed to comply.
(e) Review in certain cases by the Secretary. If the Secretary has not personally made the final decision referred to
in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section, a recipient or applicant or the
counsel for the Department may request the Secretary to review a decision of the Reviewing Authority in accordance with rules of procedure issued
by the responsible Department official.
Such review is not a matter of right
and shall be granted only where the
Secretary determines there are special
and important reasons therefor. The
Secretary may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part. He may also
review such a decision upon his own
motion in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible Department official. In the absence of a
review under this paragraph, a final decision referred to in paragraphs (a), (b),
(c) of this section shall become the

final decision of the Department when
the Secretary transmits it as such to
Congressional committees with the report required under section 602 of the
Act. Failure of an applicant or recipient to file an exception with the Reviewing Authority or to request review
under this paragraph shall not be
deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.
(f) Content of orders. The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in
whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such
terms, conditions, and other provisions
as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this
regulation, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation
applies will thereafter be extended
under such law or laws to the applicant
or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance
of an assurance given by it pursuant to
this regulation, or to have otherwise
failed to comply with this regulation
unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible Department official that it will
fully comply with this regulation.
(g) Post-termination proceedings. (1) An
applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies
the terms and conditions of that order
for such eligibility or if it brings itself
into compliance with this part and provides reasonable assurance that it will
fully comply with this part. An elementary or secondary school or school
system which is unable to file an assurance of compliance with § 100.3 shall be
restored to full eligibility to receive
Federal financial assistance, if it files
a court order or a plan for desegregation which meets the requirements of
§ 100.4(c), and provides reasonable assurance that it will comply with the
court order or plan.

§ 100.12

pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible Department official to restore fully its eligibility to receive
Federal financial assistance. Any such
request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of
paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the
responsible Department official determines that those requirements have
been satisfied, he shall restore such eligibility.
(3) If the responsible Department official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to
have been in error. It shall thereupon
be given an expeditious hearing, with a
decision on the record, in accordance
with rules of procedure issued by the
responsible Department official. The
applicant or recipient will be restored
to such eligibility if it proves at such
hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this
paragraph are pending, the sanctions
imposed by the order issued under
paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

§ 100.12 Effect on other regulations;

(a) Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders, or like directions
heretofore issued by any officer of the
Department which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the
ground of race, color, or national origin under any program to which this
regulation applies, and which authorize
the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for
or recipient of assistance for failure to
comply with such requirements, are

hereby superseded to the extent that
such discrimination is prohibited by
this regulation, except that nothing in
this regulation shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction,
or like direction prior to the effective
date of this regulation. Nothing in this
regulation, however, shall be deemed to
supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):
(1) Executive Order 11063 and regulations issued thereunder, or any other
regulations or instructions, insofar as
such Order, regulations, or instructions
prohibit discrimination on the ground
of race, color, or national origin in any
program or situation to which this regulation is inapplicable, or prohibit discrimination on any other ground; or
(2) Requirements for Emergency
School Assistance as published in 35
FR 13442 and codified as 34 CFR part
280.
(b) Forms and instructions. The responsible Department official shall
issue and promptly make available to
interested persons forms and detailed
instructions and procedures for effectuating this part.
(c) Supervision and coordination. The
responsible Department official may
from time to time assign to officials of
the Department, or to officials of other
departments or agencies of the Government with the consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in
connection with the effectuation of the
purposes of title VI of the Act and this
regulation (other than responsibility
for review as provided in § 100.10(e)), including the achievements of effective
coordination and maximum uniformity
within the Department and within the
Executive Branch of the Government
in the application of title VI and this
regulation to similar programs and in
similar situations. Any action taken,
determination made, or requirement
imposed by an official of another Department or Agency acting pursuant to
an assignment of responsibility under
this section shall have the same effect
as though such action had been taken
by the responsible official of this Department.

to any or all institutions described above.
II. RESPONSIBILITIES ASSIGNED ONLY TO
STATE AGENCY RECIPIENTS
A. RESPONSIBILITIES OF ALL STATE AGENCY
RECIPIENTS
State agency recipients, in addition to
complying with all other provisions of the
Guidelines relevant to them, may not require, approve of, or engage in any discrimination or denial of services on the basis of
race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap
in performing any of the following activities:
1. Establishment of criteria or formulas for
distribution of Federal or State funds to vocational education programs in the State;
2. Establishment of requirements for admission to or requirements for the administration of vocational education programs;
3. Approval of action by local entities providing vocational education. (For example, a
State agency must ensure compliance with
Section IV of these Guidelines if and when it
reviews a vocational education agency decision to create or change a geographic service
area.);

4. Conducting its own programs. (For example, in employing its staff it may not discriminate on the basis of sex or handicap.)
B. STATE AGENCIES PERFORMING OVERSIGHT
RESPONSIBILITIES
The State agency responsible for the administration of vocational education programs must adopt a compliance program to
prevent, identify and remedy discrimination
on the basis of race, color, national origin,
sex or handicap by its subrecipients. (A
‘‘subrecipient,’’ in this context, is a local
agency or vocational education center that
receives financial assistance through a State
agency.) This compliance program must include:
1. Collecting and analyzing civil rights related data and information that subrecipients compile for their own purposes or that
are submitted to State and Federal officials
under existing authorities;
2. Conducting periodic compliance reviews
of selected subrecipients (i.e., an investigation of a subrecipient to determine whether
it engages in unlawful discrimination in any
aspect of its program); upon finding unlawful
discrimination, notifying the subrecipient of
steps it must take to attain compliance and
attempting to obtain voluntary compliance;
3. Providing technical assistance upon request to subrecipients. This will include assisting subrecipients to identify unlawful
discrimination and instructing them in remedies for and prevention of such discrimination;
4. Periodically reporting its activities and
findings under the foregoing paragraphs, including findings of unlawful discrimination
under paragraph 2, immediately above, to
the Office for Civil Rights.
State agencies are not required to terminate or defer assistance to any subrecipient.
Nor are they required to conduct hearings.
The responsibilities of the Office for Civil
Rights to collect and analyze data, to conduct compliance reviews, to investigate complaints and to provide technical assistance
are not diminished or attenuated by the requirements of Section II of the Guidelines.
C. STATEMENT OF PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES
Within one year from the publication of
these Guidelines in final form, each State
agency recipient performing oversight responsibilities must submit to the Office for
Civil Rights the methods of administration
and related procedures it will follow to comply with the requirements described in paragraphs A and B immediately above. The Department will review each submission and
will promptly either approve it, or return it
to State officials for revision.

III. DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER FUNDS FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
A. AGENCY RESPONSIBILITIES
Recipients that administer grants for vocational education must distribute Federal,
State, or local vocational education funds so
that no student or group of students is unlawfully denied an equal opportunity to benefit from vocational education on the basis
of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.
B. DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS
Recipients may not adopt a formula or
other method for the allocation of Federal,
State, or local vocational education funds
that has the effect of discriminating on the
basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or
handicap. However, a recipient may adopt a
formula or other method of allocation that
uses as a factor race, color, national origin,
sex, or handicap [or an index or proxy for
race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap
e.g., number of persons receiving Aid to
Families with Dependent Children or with
limited English speaking ability] if the factor is included to compensate for past discrimination or to comply with those provisions of the Vocational Education Amendments of 1976 designed to assist specified protected groups.

formed of and able to seek funds. State agencies that provide technical assistance for the
completion of the application process must
provide such assistance without discrimination against any one recipient or class of recipients.
F. ALTERATION OF FUND DISTRIBUTION TO
PROVIDE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY
If the Office for Civil Rights finds that a
recipient’s system for distributing vocational education funds unlawfully discriminates on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap, it will require the recipient to adopt an alternative nondiscriminatory method of distribution. The Office
for Civil Rights may also require the recipient to compensate for the effects of its past
unlawful discrimination in the distribution
of funds.
IV. ACCESS AND ADMISSION OF STUDENTS TO
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS
A. RECIPIENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Criteria controlling student eligibility for
admission to vocational education schools,
facilities and programs may not unlawfully
discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap. A recipient
may not develop, impose, maintain, approve,
or implement such discriminatory admissions criteria.
B. SITE SELECTION FOR VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS

C. EXAMPLE OF A PATTERN SUGGESTING
UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION
In each State it is likely that some local
recipients will enroll greater proportions of
minority students in vocational education
than the State-wide proportion of minority
students in vocational education. A funding
formula or other method of allocation that
results in such local recipients receiving perpupil allocations of Federal or State vocational education funds lower than the Statewide average per-pupil allocation will be presumed unlawfully discriminatory.

State and local recipients may not select
or approve a site for a vocational education
facility for the purpose or with the effect of
excluding, segregating, or otherwise discriminating against students on the basis of
race, color, or national origin. Recipients
must locate vocational education facilities
at sites that are readily accessible to both
nonminority and minority communities, and
that do not tend to identify the facility or
program as intended for nonminority or minority students.

D. DISTRIBUTION THROUGH COMPETITIVE
GRANTS OR CONTRACTS

C. ELIGIBILITY FOR ADMISSION TO VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION CENTERS BASED ON RESIDENCE

Each State agency that establishes criteria
for awarding competitive vocational education grants or contracts must establish
and apply the criteria without regard to the
race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap
of any or all of a recipient’s students, except
to compensate for past discrimination.

Recipients may not establish, approve or
maintain geographic boundaries for a vocational education center service area or attendance zone, (hereinafter ‘‘service area’’),
that unlawfully exclude students on the
basis of race, color, or national origin. The
Office for Civil Rights will presume, subject
to rebuttal, that any one or combination of
the following circumstances indicates that
the boundaries of a given service area are unlawfully constituted:
1. A school system or service area contiguous to the given service area, contains minority or nonminority students in substantially greater proportion than the given
service area;

E. APPLICATION PROCESSES FOR COMPETITIVE
OR DISCRETIONARY GRANTS
State agencies must disseminate information needed to satisfy the requirements of
any application process for competitive or
discretionary grants so that all recipients,
including those having a high percentage of
minority or handicapped students, are in-

2. A substantial number of minority students who reside outside the given vocational education center service area, and
who are not eligible for the center reside,
nonetheless, as close to the center as a substantial number of non-minority students
who are eligible for the center;
3. The over-all vocational education program of the given service area in comparison
to the over-all vocational education program
of a contiguous school system or service area
enrolling a substantially greater proportion
of minority students:
(a) Provides its students with a broader
range of curricular offerings, facilities and
equipment; or (b) provides its graduates
greater opportunity for employment in jobs:
(i) For which there is a demonstrated need
in the community or region; (ii) that pay
higher entry level salaries or wages; or (iii)
that are generally acknowledged to offer
greater prestige or status.
D. ADDITIONS AND RENOVATIONS TO EXISTING
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION FACILITIES
A recipient may not add to, modify, or renovate the physical plant of a vocational education facility in a manner that creates,
maintains, or increases student segregation
on the basis of race, color, national origin,
sex, or handicap.
E. REMEDIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF SITE SELECTION AND GEOGRAPHIC SERVICE AREA REQUIREMENTS

If the conditions specified in paragraphs
IV, A, B, C, or D, immediately above, are
found and not rebutted by proof of nondiscrimination, the Office for Civil Rights
will require the recipient(s) to submit a plan
to remedy the discrimination. The following
are examples of steps that may be included
in the plan, where necessary to overcome the
discrimination:
(1) Redrawing of the boundaries of the vocational education center’s service area to
include areas unlawfully excluded and/or to
exclude areas unlawfully included; (2) provision of transportation to students residing in
areas unlawfully excluded; (3) provision of
additional programs and services to students
who would have been eligible for attendance
at the vocational education center but for
the discriminatory service area or site selection; (4) reassignment of students; and (5)
construction of new facilities or expansion of
existing facilities.
F. ELIGIBILITY FOR ADMISSION TO SECONDARY
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION CENTERS BASED ON
NUMERICAL LIMITS IMPOSED ON SENDING
SCHOOLS
A recipient may not adopt or maintain a
system for admission to a secondary vocational education center or program that limits admission to a fixed number of students

from each sending school included in the
center’s service area if such a system disproportionately excludes students from the
center on the basis of race, sex, national origin or handicap. (Example: Assume 25 percent of a school district’s high school students are black and that most of those black
students are enrolled in one high school; the
white students, 75 percent of the district’s
total enrollment, are generally enrolled in
the five remaining high schools. This paragraph prohibits a system of admission to the
secondary vocational education center that
limits eligibility to a fixed and equal number
of students from each of the district’s six
high schools.)
G. REMEDIES FOR VIOLATION OF ELIGIBILITY
BASED ON NUMERICAL LIMITS REQUIREMENTS
If the Office for Civil Rights finds a violation of paragraph F, above, the recipient
must implement an alternative system of admissions that does not disproportionately
exclude students on the basis of race, color,
national origin, sex, or handicap.
H. ELIGIBILITY FOR ADMISSION TO VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION CENTERS, BRANCHES OR ANNEXES
BASED UPON STUDENT OPTION
A vocational education center, branch or
annex, open to all students in a service area
and predominantly enrolling minority students or students of one race, national origin
or sex, will be presumed unlawfully segregated if:
(1) It was established by a recipient for
members of one race, national origin or sex;
or (2) it has since its construction been attended primarily by members of one race,
national origin or sex; or (3) most of its program offerings have traditionally been selected predominantly by members of one
race, national origin or sex.
I. REMEDIES FOR FACILITY SEGREGATION
UNDER STUDENT OPTION PLANS
If the conditions specified in paragraph IV–
H are found and not rebutted by proof of nondiscrimination, the Office for Civil Rights
will require the recipient(s) to submit a plan
to remedy the segregation. The following are
examples of steps that may be included in
the plan, where necessary to overcome the
discrimination:
(1) Elimination of program duplication in
the segregated facility and other proximate
vocational facilities; (2) relocation or ‘‘clustering’’ of programs or courses; (3) adding
programs and courses that traditionally
have been identified as intended for members
of a particular race, national origin or sex to
schools that have traditionally served members of the other sex or traditionally served
persons of a different race or national origin;
(4) merger of programs into one facility
through school closings or new construction;

students whose enrollment would promote
desegregation.
J. [RESERVED]

minority students. A recipient must demonstrate that a concentration of students
with limited English language skills in one
or a few programs is not the result of discriminatory limitations upon the opportunities available to such students.

K. ELIGIBILITY BASED ON EVALUATION OF
EACH APPLICANT UNDER ADMISSIONS CRITERIA
Recipients may not judge candidates for
admission to vocational education programs
on the basis of criteria that have the effect
of disproportionately excluding persons of a
particular race, color, national origin, sex,
or handicap. However, if a recipient can demonstrate that such criteria have been validated as essential to participation in a given
program and that alternative equally valid
criteria that do not have such a disproportionate adverse effect are unavailable, the
criteria will be judged nondiscriminatory.
Examples of admissions criteria that must
meet this test are past academic performance, record of disciplinary infractions,
counselors’ approval, teachers’ recommendations, interest inventories, high school diplomas and standardized tests, such as the Test
of Adult Basic Education (TABE).
An introductory, preliminary, or exploratory course may not be established as a prerequisite for admission to a program unless
the course has been and is available without
regard to race, color, national origin, sex,
and handicap. However, a course that was
formerly only available on a discriminatory
basis may be made a prerequisite for admission to a program if the recipient can demonstrate that:
(a) The course is essential to participation
in the program; and (b) the course is presently available to those seeking enrollment
for the first time and to those formerly excluded.
L. ELIGIBILITY OF NATIONAL ORIGIN MINORITY
PERSONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH LANGUAGE
SKILLS
Recipients may not restrict an applicant’s
admission to vocational education programs
because the applicant, as a member of a national origin minority with limited English
language skills, cannot participate in and
benefit from vocational instruction to the
same extent as a student whose primary language is English. It is the responsibility of
the recipient to identify such applicants and
assess their ability to participate in vocational instruction.
Acceptable methods of identification include: (1) Identification by administrative
staff, teachers, or parents of secondary level
students; (2) identification by the student in
postsecondary or adult programs; and (3) appropriate diagnostic procedures, if necessary.
Recipients must take steps to open all vocational programs to these national origin

M. REMEDIAL ACTION IN BEHALF OF PERSONS
WITH LIMITED ENGLISH LANGUAGE SKILLS
If the Office for Civil Rights finds that a
recipient has denied national origin minority persons admission to a vocational school
or program because of their limited English
language skills or has assigned students to
vocational programs solely on the basis of
their limited English language skills, the recipient will be required to submit a remedial
plan that insures national origin minority
students equal access to vocational education programs.
N. EQUAL ACCESS FOR HANDICAPPED
STUDENTS
Recipients may not deny handicapped students access to vocational education programs or courses because of architectural or
equipment barriers, or because of the need
for related aids and services or auxiliary
aids. If necessary, recipients must:
(1) Modify instructional equipment; (2)
modify or adapt the manner in which the
courses are offered; (3) house the program in
facilities that are readily accessible to mobility impaired students or alter facilities to
make them readily accessible to mobility
impaired students; and (4) provide auxiliary
aids that effectively make lectures and necessary materials available to postsecondary
handicapped students; (5) provide related
aids or services that assure secondary students an appropriate education.
Academic requirements that the recipient
can demonstrate are essential to a program
of instruction or to any directly related licensing requirement will not be regarded as
discriminatory. However, where possible, a
recipient must adjust those requirements to
the needs of individual handicapped students.
Access to vocational programs or courses
may not be denied handicapped students on
the ground that employment opportunities
in any occupation or profession may be more
limited for handicapped persons than for
non-handicapped persons.
O. PUBLIC NOTIFICATION
Prior to the beginning of each school year,
recipients must advise students, parents, employees and the general public that all vocational opportunities will be offered without
regard to race, color, national origin, sex, or
handicap. Announcement of this policy of

34 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)

non-discrimination may be made, for example, in local newspapers, recipient publications and/or other media that reach the general public, program beneficiaries, minorities (including national origin minorities
with limited English language skills),
women, and handicapped persons. A brief
summary of program offerings and admission
criteria should be included in the announcement; also the name, address and telephone
number of the person designated to coordinate Title IX and Section 504 compliance activity.
If a recipient’s service area contains a
community of national origin minority persons with limited English language skills,
public notification materials must be disseminated to that community in its language and must state that recipients will
take steps to assure that the lack of English
language skills will not be a barrier to admission and participation in vocational education programs.
V. COUNSELING AND PREVOCATIONAL
PROGRAMS
A. RECIPIENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Recipients must insure that their counseling materials and activities (including
student program selection and career/employment selection), promotional, and recruitment efforts do not discriminate on the
basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or
handicap.
B. COUNSELING AND PROSPECTS FOR SUCCESS
Recipients that operate vocational education programs must insure that counselors
do not direct or urge any student to enroll in
a particular career or program, or measure
or predict a student’s prospects for success
in any career or program based upon the student’s race, color, national origin, sex, or
handicap. Recipients may not counsel handicapped students toward more restrictive career objectives than nonhandicapped students with similar abilities and interests. If
a vocational program disproportionately enrolls male or female students, minority or
nonminority students, or handicapped students, recipients must take steps to insure
that the disproportion does not result from
unlawful discrimination in counseling activities.
C. STUDENT RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES
Recipients must conduct their student recruitment activities so as not to exclude or
limit opportunities on the basis of race,
color, national origin, sex, or handicap.
Where recruitment activities involve the
presentation or portrayal of vocational and
career opportunities, the curricula and programs described should cover a broad range
of occupational opportunities and not be

limited on the basis of the race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap of the students or potential students to whom the
presentation is made. Also, to the extent
possible, recruiting teams should include
persons of different races, national origins,
sexes, and handicaps.
D. COUNSELING OF STUDENTS WITH LIMITED
ENGLISH-SPEAKING ABILITY OR HEARING IMPAIRMENTS

Recipients must insure that counselors can
effectively communicate with national origin minority students with limited English
language skills and with students who have
hearing impairments. This requirement may
be satisfied by having interpreters available.
E. PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES
Recipients may not undertake promotional
efforts (including activities of school officials, counselors, and vocational staff) in a
manner that creates or perpetuates stereotypes or limitations based on race, color, national origin, sex or handicap. Examples of
promotional efforts are career days, parents’
night, shop demonstrations, visitations by
groups of prospective students and by representatives from business and industry. Materials that are part of promotional efforts
may not create or perpetuate stereotypes
through text or illustration. To the extent
possible they should portray males or females, minorities or handicapped persons in
programs and occupations in which these
groups traditionally have not been represented. If a recipient’s service area contains a community of national origin minority persons with limited English language
skills, promotional literature must be distributed to that community in its language.
VI. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN THE VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION INSTRUCTIONAL SETTING
A. ACCOMMODATIONS FOR HANDICAPPED
STUDENTS
Recipients must place secondary level
handicapped students in the regular educational environment of any vocational education program to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the student unless
it can be demonstrated that the education of
the handicapped person in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids
and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. Handicapped students may be placed
in a program only after the recipient satisfies the provisions of the Department’s Regulation, 34 CFR, part 104, relating to evaluation, placement, and procedural safeguards.
If a separate class or facility is identifiable
as being for handicapped persons, the facility, the programs, and the services must be
comparable to the facilities, programs, and
services offered to nonhandicapped students.

Pt. 100, App. B

B. STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
Recipients may not award financial assistance in the form of loans, grants, scholarships, special funds, subsidies, compensation
for work, or prizes to vocational education
students on the basis of race, color, national
origin, sex, or handicap, except to overcome
the effects of past discrimination. Recipients
may administer sex restricted financial assistance where the assistance and restriction
are established by will, trust, bequest, or any
similar legal instrument, if the overall effect
of all financial assistance awarded does not
discriminate on the basis of sex. Materials
and information used to notify students of
opportunities for financial assistance may
not contain language or examples that would
lead applicants to believe the assistance is
provided on a discriminatory basis. If a recipient’s service area contains a community
of national origin minority persons with limited English language skills, such information must be disseminated to that community in its language.
C. HOUSING IN RESIDENTIAL POSTSECONDARY
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION CENTERS
Recipients must extend housing opportunities without discrimination based on race,
color, national origin, sex, or handicap. This
obligation extends to recipients that provide
on-campus housing and/or that have agreements with providers of off-campus housing.
In particular, a recipient postsecondary vocational education program that provides
on-campus or off-campus housing to its nonhandicapped students must provide, at the
same cost and under the same conditions,
comparable convenient and accessible housing to handicapped students.
D. COMPARABLE FACILITIES
Recipients must provide changing rooms,
showers, and other facilities for students of
one sex that are comparable to those provided to students of the other sex. This may
be accomplished by alternating use of the
same facilities or by providing separate,
comparable facilities.
Such facilities must be adapted or modified to the extent necessary to make the vocational education program readily accessible to handicapped persons.
VII. WORK STUDY, COOPERATIVE VOCATIONAL
EDUCATION, JOB PLACEMENT, AND APPRENTICE TRAINING
A. RESPONSIBILITIES IN COOPERATIVE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS, WORK-STUDY
PROGRAMS, AND JOB PLACEMENT PROGRAMS
A recipient must insure that: (a) It does
not discriminate against its students on the
basis of race, color, national origin, sex, or
handicap in making available opportunities
in cooperative education, work study and job

placement programs; and (b) students participating in cooperative education, work
study and job placement programs are not
discriminated against by employers or prospective employers on the basis of race,
color, national origin, sex, or handicap in recruitment, hiring, placement, assignment to
work tasks, hours of employment, levels of
responsibility, and in pay.
If a recipient enters into a written agreement for the referral or assignment of students to an employer, the agreement must
contain an assurance from the employer that
students will be accepted and assigned to
jobs and otherwise treated without regard to
race, color, national origin, sex, or handicap.
Recipients may not honor any employer’s
request for students who are free of handicaps or for students of a particular race,
color, national origin, or sex. In the event an
employer or prospective employer is or has
been subject to court action involving discrimination in employment, school officials
should rely on the court’s findings if the decision resolves the issue of whether the employer has engaged in unlawful discrimination.
B. APPRENTICE TRAINING PROGRAMS
A recipient may not enter into any agreement for the provision or support of apprentice training for students or union members
with any labor union or other sponsor that
discriminates against its members or applicants for membership on the basis of race,
color, national origin, sex, or handicap. If a
recipient enters into a written agreement
with a labor union or other sponsor providing for apprentice training, the agreement must contain an assurance from the
union or other sponsor:
(1) That it does not engage in such discrimination against its membership or applicants for membership; and (2) that apprentice training will be offered and conducted
for its membership free of such discrimination.
VIII. EMPLOYMENT OF FACULTY AND STAFF
A. EMPLOYMENT GENERALLY
Recipients may not engage in any employment practice that discriminates against
any employee or applicant for employment
on the basis of sex or handicap. Recipients
may not engage in any employment practice
that discriminates on the basis of race,
color, or national origin if such discrimination tends to result in segregation, exclusion
or other discrimination against students.
B. RECRUITMENT
Recipients may not limit their recruitment for employees to schools, communities,
or companies disproportionately composed of
persons of a particular race, color, national

notified that the recipient does not discriminate in employment on the basis of race,
color, national origin, sex, or handicap.

ment authority, the State education agency
operating the program must insure that recruitment and hiring of staff for the vocational education center is conducted in accordance with the requirements of these
Guidelines.

C. PATTERNS OF DISCRIMINATION

IX. PROPRIETARY VOCATIONAL EDUCATION
SCHOOLS

Whenever the Office for Civil Rights finds
that in light of the representation of protected groups in the relevant labor market
there is a significant underrepresentation or
overrepresentation of protected group persons on the staff of a vocational education
school or program, it will presume that the
disproportion results from unlawful discrimination. This presumption can be overcome by proof that qualified persons of the
particular race, color, national origin, or
sex, or that qualified handicapped persons
are not in fact available in the relevant labor
market.
D. SALARY POLICIES
Recipients must establish and maintain
faculty salary scales and policy based upon
the conditions and responsibilities of employment, without regard to race, color, national origin, sex or handicap.
E. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR
HANDICAPPED APPLICANTS
Recipients must provide equal employment
opportunities for teaching and administrative positions to handicapped applicants who
can perform the essential functions of the
position in question. Recipients must make
reasonable accommodation for the physical
or mental limitations of handicapped applicants who are otherwise qualified unless recipients can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship.
F. THE EFFECTS OF PAST DISCRIMINATION
Recipients must take steps to overcome
the effects of past discrimination in the recruitment, hiring, and assignment of faculty.
Such steps may include the recruitment or
reassignment of qualified persons of a particular race, national origin, or sex, or who
are handicapped.
G. STAFF OF STATE ADVISORY COUNCILS OF
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION

A. RECIPIENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Proprietary vocational education schools
that are recipients of Federal financial assistance through Federal student assistance
programs or otherwise are subject to all of
the requirements of the Department’s regulations and these Guidelines.
B. ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY
Enforcement of the provisions of Title IX
of the Education Amendments of 1972 and
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
is the responsibility of the Department of
Education. However, authority to enforce
Title VI of the Civil rights Act of 1964 for
proprietary vocational education schools has
been delegated to the Veterans Administration.
When the Office for Civil Rights receives a
Title VI complaint alleging discrimination
by a proprietary vocational education school
it will forward the complaint to the Veterans
Administration and cite the applicable requirements of the Department’s regulations
and these Guidelines. The complainant will
be notified of such action.

§ 101.4 Suspension of rules.
Upon notice to all parties, the reviewing authority or the presiding officer, with respect to matters pending
before them, may modify or waive any
rule in this part upon determination
that no party will be unduly prejudiced
and the ends of justice will thereby be
served.

Subpart B—Appearance and
Practice
§ 101.11 Appearance.
A party may appear in person or by
counsel and participate fully in any
proceeding. A State agency or a corporation may appear by any of its officers or by any employee it authorizes
to appear on its behalf. Counsel must
be members in good standing of the bar
of a State, Territory, or possession of
the United States or of the District of
Columbia or the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico.
§ 101.12 Authority for representation.
Any individual acting in a representative capacity in any proceeding may
be required to show his authority to
act in such capacity.
§ 101.13 Exclusion from hearing for
misconduct.
Disrespectful, disorderly, or contumacious language or contemptuous
conduct, refusal to comply with directions, or continued use of dilatory tactics by any person at any hearing before a presiding officer shall constitute
grounds for immediate exclusion of
such person from the hearing by the
presiding officer.

Subpart C—Parties
§ 101.21 Parties.
(a) The term party shall include an
applicant or recipient or other person
to whom a notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing has been mailed
naming him a respondent.
(b) The Assistant Secretary for Civil
Rights of the Department of Education, shall be deemed a party to all

§ 101.22

Amici curiae.

(a) Any interested person or organization may file a petition to participate in a proceeding as an amicus curiae. Such petition shall be filed prior
to the prehearing conference, or if none
is held, before the commencement of
the hearing, unless the petitioner
shows good cause for filing the petition
later. The presiding officer may grant
the petition if he finds that the petitioner has a legitimate interest in the
proceedings, that such participation
will not unduly delay the outcome, and
may contribute materially to the proper disposition thereof. An amicus curiae is not a party and may not introduce evidence at a hearing.
(b) An amicus curiae may submit a
statement of position to the presiding
officer prior to the beginning of a hearing, and shall serve a copy on each
party. The amicus curiae may submit a
brief on each occasion a decision is to
be made or a prior decision is subject
to review. His brief shall be filed and
served on each party within the time
limits applicable to the party whose
position he deems himself to support;
or if he does not deem himself to support the position of any party, within
the longest time limit applicable to
any party at that particular stage of
the proceedings.
(c) When all parties have completed
their initial examination of a witness,
any amicus curiae may request the presiding officer to propound specific
questions to the witness. The presiding
officer, in his discretion, may grant
any such request if he believes the proposed additional testimony may assist
materially in elucidating factual matters at issue between the parties and
will not expand the issues.
§ 101.23

Complainants not parties.

A person submitting a complaint pursuant to § 100.7(b) of this title is not a
party to the proceedings governed by
this part, but may petition, after proceedings are initiated, to become an
amicus curiae.

knowledge, information, and belief
there is good ground to support it, and
that it is not interposed for delay. If a
document is not signed or is signed

prepaid. When a party or amicus has
appeared by attorney or other representative, service upon such attorney
or representative will be deemed service upon the party or amicus. Documents served by mail preferably should
be mailed in sufficient time to reach
the addressee by the date on which the
original is due to be filed, and should
be air mailed if the addressee is more
than 300 miles distant.
§ 101.35

Date of service.

The date of service shall be the day

Certificate of service.

The original of every document filed
and required to be served upon parties
to a proceeding shall be endorsed with

Subpart F—Proceedings Prior to
Hearing
§ 101.51 Notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing.
Proceedings are commenced by mailing a notice of hearing or opportunity
for hearing to an affected applicant or
recipient, pursuant to § 100.9 of this
title.
§ 101.52

Answer to notice.

The respondent, applicant or recipient may file an answer to the notice
within 20 days after service thereof.
Answers shall admit or deny specifically and in detail each allegation of
the notice, unless the respondent party
is without knowledge, in which case his
answer should so state, and the statement will be deemed a denial. Allegations of fact in the notice not denied or
controverted by answer shall be
deemed admitted. Matters alleged as
affirmative defenses shall be separately
stated and numbered. Failure of the respondent to file an answer within the
20-day period following service of the
notice may be deemed an admission of
all matters of fact recited in the notice.

§ 101.53 Amendment of notice or answer.
The Assistant Secretary for Civil
Rights may amend the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing once as
a matter of course before an answer
thereto is served, and each respondent
may amend his answer once as a matter of course not later than 10 days before the date fixed for hearing but in no
event later than 20 days from the date
of service of his original answer. Otherwise a notice or answer may be amended only by leave of the presiding officer. A respondent shall file his answer
to an amended notice within the time
remaining for filing the answer to the
original notice or within 10 days after
service of the amended notice, whichever period may be the longer, unless
the presiding officer otherwise orders.
§ 101.54 Request for hearing.
Within 20 days after service of a notice of opportunity for hearing which
does not fix a date for hearing the respondent, either in his answer or in a
separate document, may request a
hearing. Failure of the respondent to
request a hearing shall be deemed a
waiver of the right to a hearing and to
constitute his consent to the making of
a decision on the basis of such information as is available.
§ 101.55 Consolidation.
The responsible Department official
may provide for proceedings in the Department to be joined or consolidated
for hearing with proceedings in other
Federal departments or agencies, by
agreement with such other departments or agencies. All parties to any
proceeding consolidated subsequently
to service of the notice of hearing or
opportunity for hearing shall be
promptly served with notice of such
consolidation.

Motions and petitions shall state the
relief sought, the authority relied
upon, and the facts alleged. If made before or after the hearing, these matters
shall be in writing. If made at the hearing, they may be stated orally; but the

expiration of the time for filing responses thereto, but may overrule or
deny such motion or petition without
awaiting response: Provided, however,
That prehearing conferences, hearings
and decisions need not be delayed pending disposition of motions or petitions.
Oral motions and petitions may be
ruled on immediately. Motions and petitions submitted to the reviewing authority or the presiding officer, respectively, and not disposed of in separate
rulings or in their respective decisions
will be deemed denied. Oral arguments
shall not be held or written motions or
petitions unless the presiding officer in
his discretion expressly so orders.

34 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)

Subpart H—Hearing Procedures
§ 101.71 Statement of position and trial
briefs.
The presiding officer may require
parties and amici curiae to file written
statements of position prior to the beginning of a hearing. The presiding officer may also require the parties to
submit trial briefs.
§ 101.72 Evidentiary purpose.
(a) The hearing is directed to receiving factual evidence and expert opinion
testimony related to the issues in the
proceeding. Argument will not be received in evidence; rather it should be
presented in statements, memoranda,
or briefs, as determined by the presiding officer. Brief opening statements, which shall be limited to statement of the party’s position and what
he intends to prove, may be made at
hearings.
(b) Hearings for the reception of evidence will be held only in cases where
issues of fact must be resolved in order
to determine whether the respondent
has failed to comply with one or more
applicable requirements of part 100 of
this title. In any case where it appears
from the respondent’s answer to the
notice of hearing or opportunity for
hearing, from his failure timely to answer, or from his admissions or stipulations in the record, that there are no
matters of material fact in dispute, the
reviewing authority or presiding officer
may enter an order so finding, vacating
the hearing date if one has been set,
and fixing the time for filing briefs
under § 101.101. Thereafter the proceedings shall go to conclusion in accordance with subpart J of this part.
The presiding officer may allow an appeal from such order in accordance
with § 101.86.
§ 101.73 Testimony.
Testimony shall be given orally
under oath or affirmation by witnesses
at the hearing; but the presiding officer, in his discretion, may require or
permit that the direct testimony of
any witness be prepared in writing and
served on all parties in advance of the
hearing. Such testimony may be adopted by the witness at the hearing, and
filed as part of the record thereof. Un-

less authorized by the presiding officer,
witnesses will not be permitted to read
prepared testimony into the record.
Except as provided in §§ 101.75 and
101.76, witnesses shall be available at
the hearing for cross-examination.
§ 101.74 Exhibits.
Proposed exhibits shall be exchanged
at the prehearing conference, or otherwise prior to the hearing if the presiding officer so requires. Proposed exhibits not so exchanged may be denied
admission as evidence. The authenticity of all proposed exhibits exchanged prior to hearing will be
deemed admitted unless written objection thereto is filed prior to the hearing or unless good cause is shown at
the hearing for failure to file such written objection.
§ 101.75 Affidavits.
An affidavit is; not inadmissible as
such. Unless the presiding officer fixes
other time periods affidavits shall be
filed and served on the parties not later
than 15 days prior to the hearing; and
not less than 7 days prior to hearing a
party may file and serve written objection to any affidavit on the ground
that he believes it necessary to test the
truth of assertions therein at hearing.
In such event the assertions objected
to will not be received in evidence unless the affiant is made available for
cross-examination, or the presiding officer determines that cross-examination is not necessary for the full and
true disclosure of facts referred to in
such assertions. Notwithstanding any
objection, however, affidavits may be
considered in the case of any respondent who waives a hearing.
§ 101.76 Depositions.
Upon such terms as may be just, for
the convenience of the parties or of the
Department, the presiding officer may
authorize or direct the testimony of
any witness to be taken by deposition.
§ 101.77 Admissions as to facts and
documents.
Not later than 15 days prior to the
scheduled date of the hearing except
for good cause shown, or prior to such
earlier date as the presiding officer
may order, any party may serve upon

an opposing party a written request for
the admission of the genuineness and
authenticity of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with
the request, or for the admission of the
truth of any relevant matters of fact
stated in the request. Each of the matters of which an admission is requested
shall be deemed admitted, unless within a period designated in the request
(not less than 10 days after service
thereof, or within such further time as
the presiding officer or the reviewing
authority if no presiding officer has yet
been designated may allow upon motion and notice) the party to whom the
request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters
of which an admission is requested or
setting forth in detail the reasons why
he cannot truthfully either admit or
deny such matters. Copies of requests
for admission and answers thereto
shall be served on all parties. Any admission made by a party to such request is only for the purposes of the
pending proceeding, or any proceeding
or action instituted for the enforcement of any order entered therein, and
shall not constitute and admission by
him for any other purpose or be used
against him in any other proceeding or
action.
§ 101.78

Evidence.

Irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable,
and unduly repetitious evidence will be
excluded.
§ 101.79

Cross-examination.

A witness may be cross-examined on
any matter material to the proceeding
without regard to the scope of his direct examination.
§ 101.80

Unsponsored written material.

Letters expressing views or urging
action and other unsponsored written
material regarding matters in issue in
a hearing will be placed in the correspondence section of the docket of
the proceeding. These data are not
deemed part of the evidence or record
in the hearing.

§ 101.81

Objections.

Objections to evidence shall be timely and briefly state the ground relied
upon.
§ 101.82 Exceptions to rulings of presiding officer unnecessary.
Exceptions to rulings of the presiding
officer are unnecessary. It is sufficient
that a party, at the time the ruling of
the presiding officer is sought, makes
known the action which he desires the
presiding officer to take, or his objection to an action taken, and his
grounds therefor.
§ 101.83

Official notice.

Where official notice is taken or is to
be taken of a material fact not appearing in the evidence of record, any
party, on timely request, shall be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.
§ 101.84

Public document items.

Whenever there is offered (in whole
or in part) a public document, such as
an official report, decision, opinion, or
published scientific or economic statistical data issued by any of the executive departments (or their subdivisions), legislative agencies or committees, or administrative agencies of the
Federal Government (including Government-owned corporations), or a
similar document issued by a State or
its agencies, and such document (or
part thereof) has been shown by the offeror to be reasonably available to the
public, such document need not be produced or marked for identification, but
may be offered for official notice, as a
public document item by specifying the
document or relevant part thereof.
§ 101.85 Offer of proof.
An offer of proof made in connection
with an objection taken to any ruling
of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered oral testimony shall
consist of a statement of the substance
of the evidence which counsel contends
would be adduced by such testimony;
and, if the excluded evidence consists
of evidence in documentary or written
form or of reference to documents or

§ 101.86 Appeals from ruling of presiding officer.
Rulings of the presiding officer may
not be appealed to the reviewing authority prior to his consideration of
the entire proceeding except with the
consent of the presiding officer and
where he certifies on the record or in
writing that the allowance of an interlocutory appeal is clearly necessary to
prevent exceptional delay, expense, or
prejudice to any party, or substantial
detriment to the public interest. If an
appeal is allowed, any party may file a
brief with the reviewing authority
within such period as the presiding officer directs. No oral argument will be
heard unless the reviewing authority
directs otherwise. At any time prior to
submission of the proceeding to it for
decisions, the reviewing authority may
direct the presiding officer to certify
any question or the entire record to it
for decision. Where the entire record is
so certified, the presiding officer shall
recommend a decision.

Subpart I—The Record
§ 101.91

Official transcript.

The Department will designate the
official reporter for all hearings. The
official transcripts of testimony taken,
together with any exhibits, briefs, or
memoranda of law filed therewith shall
be filed with the Department. Transcripts of testimony in hearings may
be obtained from the official reporter
by the parties and the public at rates
not to exceed the maximum rates fixed
by the contract between the Department and the reporter. Upon notice to
all parties, the presiding officer may
authorize corrections to the transcript
which involve matters of substance.
§ 101.92

Record for decision.

The transcript of testimony, exhibits, and all papers and requests filed in
the proceedings, except the correspondence section of the docket, including
rulings and any recommended or initial
decision shall constitute the exclusive
record for decision.

Subpart J—Posthearing
Procedures, Decisions
§ 101.101 Posthearing briefs: proposed
findings and conclusions.
(a) The presiding officer shall fix the
time for filing posthearing briefs,
which may contain proposed findings of
fact and conclusions of law, and, if permitted, reply briefs.
(b) Briefs should include a summary
of the evidence relied upon together
with references to exhibit numbers and
pages of the transcript, with citations
of the authorities relied upon.
§ 101.102 Decisions following hearing.
When the time for submission of
posthearing briefs has expired, the presiding officer shall certify the entire
record, including his recommended
findings and proposed decision, to the
responsible Department official; or if
so authorized he shall make an initial
decision. A copy of the recommended
findings and proposed decision, or of
the initial decision, shall be served
upon all parties, and amici, if any.
§ 101.103 Exceptions to initial or recommended decisions.
Within 20 days after the mailing of
an initial or recommended decision,
any party may file exceptions to the
decision, stating reasons therefor, with
the reviewing authority. Any other
party may file a response thereto within 30 days after the mailing of the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions, the reviewing authority shall review the decision and issue its own decision thereon.
§ 101.104 Final decisions.
(a) Where the hearing is conducted by
a hearing examiner who makes an initial decision, if no exceptions thereto
are filed within the 20-day period specified in § 101.103, such decision shall become the final decision of the Department, and shall constitute ‘‘final agency action’’ within the meaning of 5
U.S.C. 704 (formerly section 10(c) of the
Administrative Procedure Act), subject
to the provisions of § 101.106.

704 (formerly section 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act), subject to
the provisions of § 101.106.
(c) All final decisions shall be
promptly served on all parties, and
amici, if any.
§ 101.105 Oral argument to the reviewing authority.
(a) If any party desires to argue a
case orally on exceptions or replies to
exceptions to an initial or recommended decision, he shall make
such request in writing. The reviewing
authority may grant or deny such requests in its discretion. If granted, it
will serve notice of oral argument on
all parties. The notice will set forth
the order of presentation, the amount
of time allotted, and the time and
place for argument. The names of persons who will argue should be filed
with the Department hearing clerk not
later than 7 days before the date set for
oral argument.
(b) The purpose of oral argument is
to emphasize and clarify the written
argument in the briefs. Reading at
length from the brief or other texts is
not favored. Participants should confine their arguments to points of controlling importance and to points upon
which exceptions have been filed. Consolidations of appearances at oral argument by parties taking the same side
will permit the parties’ interests to be
presented more effectively in the time
allotted.
(c) Pamphlets, charts, and other
written material may be presented at
oral argument only if such material is
limited to facts already in the record
and is served on all parties and filed
with the Department hearing clerk at
least 7 days before the argument.
§ 101.106 Review by the Secretary.
Within 20 days after an initial decision becomes a final decision pursuant
to § 101.104(a) or within 20 days of the
mailing of a final decision referred to
in § 101.104(b), as the case may be, a

party may request the Secretary to review the final decision. The Secretary
may grant or deny such request, in
whole or in part, or serve notice of his
intent to review the decision in whole
or in part upon his own motion. If the
Secretary grants the requested review,
or if he serves notice of intent to review upon his own motion, each party
to the decision shall have 20 days following notice of the Secretary’s proposed action within which to file exceptions to the decision and supporting
briefs and memoranda, or briefs and
memoranda in support of the decision.
Failure of a party to request review
under this paragraph shall not be
deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.
§ 101.107 Service on amici curiae.
All briefs, exceptions, memoranda,
requests, and decisions referred to in
this subpart J shall be served upon
amici curiae at the same times and in
the same manner required for service
on parties. Any written statements of
position and trial briefs required of
parties under § 101.71 shall be served on
amici.

Subpart K—Judicial Standards of
Practice
§ 101.111 Conduct.
Parties and their representatives are
expected to conduct themselves with
honor and dignity and observe judicial
standards of practice and ethics in all
proceedings. They should not indulge
in offensive personalities, unseemly
wrangling, or intemperate accusations
or characterizations. A representative
of any party whether or not a lawyer
shall observe the traditional responsibilities of lawyers as officers of the
court and use his best efforts to restrain his client from improprieties in
connection with a proceeding.
§ 101.112 Improper conduct.
With respect to any proceeding it is
improper for any interested person to
attempt to sway the judgement of the
reviewing authority by undertaking to
bring pressure or influence to bear
upon any officer having a responsibility for a decision in the proceeding,

securing such respondent’s voluntary
compliance with any requirement of
part 100 of this title are not prohibited.

Only persons employed by or assigned to work with the reviewing authority who perform no investigative
or prosecuting function in connection
with a proceeding shall communicate
ex parte with the reviewing authority,
or the presiding officer, or any employee or person involved in the
decisional process in such proceedings

investigative or prosecuting function
in connection with the proceeding.

A prohibited communication in writing received by the Secretary, the reviewing authority, or by the presiding
officer, shall be made public by placing
it in the correspondence file of the
docket in the case and will not be considered as part of the record for decision. If the prohibited communication
is received orally a memorandum setting forth its substance shall be made
and filed in the correspondence section
of the docket in the case. A person referred to in such memorandum may file
a comment for inclusion in the docket
if he considers the memorandum to be
incorrect.

§ 101.114 Expeditious treatment.
Requests for expeditious treatment
of matters pending before the responsible Department official or the presiding officer are deemed communications on the merits, and are improper
except when forwarded from parties to
a proceeding and served upon all other
parties thereto. Such communications

§ 101.115 Matters not prohibited.
A request for information which
merely inquires about the status of a
proceeding without discussing issues or

this part. An applicant may incorporate these assurances by reference in
subsequent applications to the Department.
(b) Duration of obligation. (1) In the
case of Federal financial assistance extended in the form of real property or
to provide real property or structures
on the property, the assurance will obligate the recipient or, in the case of a
subsequent transfer, the transferee, for
the period during which the real property or structures are used for the purpose for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose
involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide personal
property, the assurance will obligate
the recipient for the period during
which it retains ownership or possession of the property.
(3) In all other cases the assurance
will obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.
(c) Covenants. (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the
form of real property or interest in the
property from the Department, the instrument effecting or recording this
transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during
which the real property is used for a
purpose for which the Federal financial
assistance is extended or for another
purpose involving the provision of
similar services or benefits.
(2) Where no transfer of property is
involved but property is purchased or
improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any
subsequent transfer of the property.
(3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real
property or interest in the property
from the Department, the covenant
shall also include a condition coupled
with a right to be reserved by the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property
proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security

for financing construction of new, or
improvement of existing, facilities on
the property for the purposes for which
the property was transferred, the Assistant Secretary may, upon request of
the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such
conditions as he or she deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of
such right to revert title for so long as
the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

take such remedial action as the Assistant Secretary deems necessary to
overcome the effects of the discrimination.
(2) Where a recipient is found to have
discriminated against persons on the
basis of handicap in violation of section 504 or this part and where another
recipient exercises control over the recipient that has discriminated, the Assistant Secretary, where appropriate,
may require either or both recipients
to take remedial action.
(3) The Assistant Secretary may,
where necessary to overcome the effects of discrimination in violation of
section 504 or this part, require a recipient to take remedial action (i) with
respect to handicapped persons who are
no longer participants in the recipient’s program or activity but who were
participants in the program or activity
when such discrimination occurred or
(ii) with respect to handicapped persons who would have been participants
in the program or activity had the discrimination not occurred.
(b) Voluntary action. A recipient may
take steps, in addition to any action
that is required by this part, to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the
recipient’s program or activity by
qualified handicapped persons.

§ 104.10 Effect of state or local law or
other requirements and effect of
employment opportunities.
(a) The obligation to comply with

basis of handicap, imposes prohibitions
or limits upon the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive
services or to practice any occupation
or profession.
(b) The obligation to comply with
this part is not obviated or alleviated
because employment opportunities in

status because of handicap.
(4) A recipient may not participate in
a contractual or other relationship
that has the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped applicants or employees to discrimination prohibited by
this subpart. The relationships referred
to in this paragraph include relationships with employment and referral

or modification of equipment or devices, the provision of readers or interpreters, and other similar actions.
(c) In determining pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section whether an accommodation would impose an undue
hardship on the operation of a recipient’s program or activity, factors to be
considered include:
(1) The overall size of the recipient’s
program or activity with respect to
number of employees, number and type
of facilities, and size of budget;
(2) The type of the recipient’s operation, including the composition and
structure of the recipient’s workforce;
and
(3) The nature and cost of the accommodation needed.

handicapped employee or applicant if
the basis for the denial is the need to
make reasonable accommodation to
the physical or mental limitations of
the employee or applicant.

§ 104.13 Employment criteria.
(a) A recipient may not make use of
any employment test or other selection
criterion that screens out or tends to
screen out handicapped persons or any
class of handicapped persons unless:

criterion, as used by the recipient, is
shown to be job-related for the position
in question, and
(2) Alternative job-related tests or
criteria that do not screen out or tend
to screen out as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Director to
be available.
(b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment
so as best to ensure that, when administered to an applicant or employee
who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the
test results accurately reflect the applicant’s or employee’s job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test
purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant’s or employee’s
impaired sensory, manual, or speaking
skills (except where those skills are
the factors that the test purports to
measure).

§ 104.14 Preemployment inquiries.
(a) Except as provided in paragraphs
(b) and (c) of this section, a recipient
may not conduct a preemployment
medical examination or may not make
preemployment inquiry of an applicant
as to whether the applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may,
however, make preemployment inquiry
into an applicant’s ability to perform
job-related functions.
(b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of
past discrimination pursuant to § 104.6
(a), when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects
of conditions that resulted in limited
participation in its federally assisted
program or activity pursuant to
§ 104.6(b), or when a recipient is taking
affirmative action pursuant to section
503 of the Act, the recipient may invite
applicants for employment to indicate
whether and to what extent they are
handicapped, Provided, That:
(1) The recipient states clearly on
any written questionnaire used for this
purpose or makes clear orally if no
written questionnaire is used that the
information requested is intended for
use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary
or affirmative action efforts; and
(2) The recipient states clearly that
the information is being requested on a
voluntary basis, that it will be kept
confidential as provided in paragraph
(d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or
employee to any adverse treatment,
and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.
(c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an
offer of employment on the results of a
medical examination conducted prior
to the employee’s entrance on duty,
Provided, That:
(1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap, and
(2) The results of such an examination are used only in accordance with
the requirements of this part.

Subpart C—Accessibility
§ 104.21 Discrimination prohibited.
No qualified handicapped person
shall, because a recipient’s facilities
are inaccessible to or unusable by
handicapped persons, be denied the
benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to
discrimination under any program or
activity to which this part applies.
§ 104.22 Existing facilities.
(a) Accessibility. A recipient shall operate its program or activity so that
when each part is viewed in its entirety, it is readily accessible to handicapped persons. This paragraph does
not require a recipient to make each of
its existing facilities or every part of a
facility accessible to and usable by
handicapped persons.
(b) Methods. A recipient may comply
with the requirements of paragraph (a)
of this section through such means as
redesign of equipment, reassignment of
classes or other services to accessible
buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of
health, welfare, or other social services
at alternate accessible sites, alteration
of existing facilities and construction
of new facilities in conformance with
the requirements of § 104.23, or any
other methods that result in making
its program or activity accessible to
handicapped persons. A recipient is not
required to make structural changes in
existing facilities where other methods
are effective in achieving compliance
with paragraph (a) of this section. In
choosing among available methods for

meeting the requirement of paragraph
(a) of this section, a recipient shall
give priority to those methods that
serve handicapped persons in the most
integrated setting appropriate.
(c) Small health, welfare, or other social
service providers. If a recipient with
fewer than fifteen employees that provides health, welfare, or other social
services finds, after consultation with
a handicapped person seeking its services, that there is no method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making a significant
alteration in its existing facilities, the
recipient may, as an alternative, refer
the handicapped person to other providers of those services that are accessible.
(d) Time period. A recipient shall comply with the requirement of paragraph
(a) of this section within sixty days of
the effective date of this part except
that where structural changes in facilities are necessary, such changes shall
be made within three years of the effective date of this part, but in any
event as expeditiously as possible.
(e) Transition plan. In the event that
structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirement of
paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop, within six months of
the effective date of this part, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The
plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including
handicapped persons or organizations
representing handicapped persons. A
copy of the transition plan shall be
made available for public inspection.
The plan shall, at a minimum:
(1) Identify physical obstacles in the
recipient’s facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to
handicappped persons;
(2) Describe in detail the methods
that will be used to make the facilities
accessible;
(3) Specify the schedule for taking
the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility in order to comply with
paagraph (a) of this section and, if the

where substantially equivalent or
greater access to and usability of the
building is provided.
(2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms

are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons
as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met and (ii) are
based upon adherence to procedures
that satisfy the requirements of
§§ 104.34, 104.35, and 104.36.
(2) Implementation of an Individualized Education Program developed in
accordance with the Education of the
Handicapped Act is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.
(3) A recipient may place a handicapped person or refer such a person for
aid, benefits, or services other than
those that it operates or provides as its
means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart. If so, the recipient remains responsible for ensuring
that the requirements of this subpart
are met with respect to any handicapped person so placed or referred.
(c) Free education—(1) General. For
the purpose of this section, the provision of a free education is the provision
of educational and related services
without cost to the handicapped person
or to his or her parents or guardian, except for those fees that are imposed on
non-handicapped persons or their parents or guardian. It may consist either
of the provision of free services or, if a
recipient places a handicapped person
or refers such person for aid, benefits,
or services not operated or provided by
the recipient as its means of carrying
out the requirements of this subpart, of
payment for the costs of the aid, benefits, or services. Funds available from
any public or private agency may be
used to meet the requirements of this
subpart. Nothing in this section shall
be construed to relieve an insurer or
similar third party from an otherwise
valid obligation to provide or pay for
services provided to a handicapped person.
(2) Transportation. If a recipient
places a handicapped person or refers
such person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the
requirements of this subpart, the recipient shall ensure that adequate
transportation to and from the aid,
benefits, or services is provided at no
greater cost than would be incurred by
the person or his or her parents or

guardian if the person were placed in
the aid, benefits, or services operated
by the recipient.
(3) Residential placement. If a public or
private residential placement is necessary to provide a free appropriate
public education to a handicapped person because of his or her handicap, the
placement, including non-medical care
and room and board, shall be provided
at no cost to the person or his or her
parents or guardian.
(4) Placement of handicapped persons
by parents. If a recipient has made
available, in conformance with the requirements of this section and § 104.34,
a free appropriate public education to a
handicapped person and the person’s
parents or guardian choose to place the
person in a private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person’s education in the private school.
Disagreements between a parent or
guardian and a recipient regarding
whether the recipient has made a free
appropriate public education available
or otherwise regarding the question of
financial responsibility are subject to
the due process procedures of § 104.36.
(d) Compliance. A recipient may not
exclude any qualified handicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education after the effective
date of this part. A recipient that is
not, on the effective date of this regulation, in full compliance with the
other requirements of the preceding
paragraphs of this section shall meet
such requirements at the earliest practicable time and in no event later than
September 1, 1978.

which this subpart applies shall educate, or shall provide for the education
of, each qualified handicapped person
in its jurisdiction with persons who are
not handicapped to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the
handicapped person. A recipient shall
place a handicapped person in the regular educational environment operated
by the recipient unless it is demonstrated by the recipient that the
education of the person in the regular

environment with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be
achieved satisfactorily. Whenever a recipient places a person in a setting
other than the regular educational environment pursuant to this paragraph,
it shall take into account the proximity of the alternate setting to the
person’s home.
(b) Nonacademic settings. In providing
or arranging for the provision of nonacademic and extracurricular services
and activities, including meals, recess
periods, and the services and activities
set forth in § 104.37(a)(2), a recipient
shall ensure that handicapped persons
participate with nonhandicapped persons in such activities and services to
the maximum extent appropriate to
the needs of the handicapped person in
question.
(c) Comparable facilities. If a recipient,
in compliance with paragraph (a) of
this section, operates a facility that is
identifiable as being for handicapped
persons, the recipient shall ensure that
the facility and the services and activities provided therein are comparable to
the other facilities, services, and activities of the recipient.
§ 104.35

Evaluation and placement.

(a) Preplacement evaluation. A recipient that operates a public elementary
or secondary education program or activity shall conduct an evaluation in
accordance with the requirements of
paragraph (b) of this section of any person who, because of handicap, needs or
is belived to need special education or
related services before taking any action with respect to the initial placement of the person in regular or special
education and any subsequent significant change in placement.
(b) Evaluation procedures. A recipient
to which this subpart applies shall establish standards and procedures for
the evaluation and placement of persons who, because of handicap, need or
are believed to need special education
or related services which ensure that:
(1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are used
and are administered by trained personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their producer;

(2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to assess
specific areas of educational need and
not merely those which are designed to
provide a single general intelligence
quotient; and
(3) Tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a
test is administered to a student with
impaired sensory, manual, or speaking
skills, the test results accurately reflect the student’s aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the
test purports to measure, rather than
reflecting the student’s impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors
that the test purports to measure).
(c) Placement procedures. In interpreting evaluation data and in making
placement decisions, a recipient shall
(1) draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and
achievement
tests,
teacher
recommendations, physical condition, social or cultural background, and adaptive behavior, (2) establish procedures to
ensure that information obtained from
all such sources is documented and
carefully considered, (3) ensure that
the placement decision is made by a
group of persons, including persons
knowledgeable about the child, the
meaning of the evaluation data, and
the placement options, and (4) ensure
that the placement decision is made in
conformity with § 104.34.
(d) Reevaluation. A recipient to which
this section applies shall establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph
(b) of this section, for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special education and related
services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with the Education for the
Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this requirement.

services and activities may include
counseling services, physical recreational athletics, transportation,
health services, recreational activities,
special interest groups or clubs sponsored by the recipients, referrals to
agencies which provide assistance to
handicapped persons, and employment
of students, including both employment by the recipient and assistance in
making available outside employment.
(b) Counseling services. A recipient to
which this subpart applies that provides personal, academic, or vocational
counseling, guidance, or placement
services to its students shall provide
these services without discrimination
on the basis of handicap. The recipient
shall ensure that qualified handicapped
students are not counseled toward
more restrictive career objectives than
are nonhandicapped students with
similar interests and abilities.

In providing physical education courses
and athletics and similar aid, benefits,
or services to any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies

applies may not charge more for the
provision of an appropriate education

applies that provides special education
shall do so in accordance with the provisions of §§ 104.35 and 104.36. Each recipient to which this section applies is

question and (ii) alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate,
adverse effect are not shown by the Assistant Secretary to be available.
(3) Shall assure itself that (i) admissions tests are selected and administered so as best to ensure that, when a
test is administered to an applicant
who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the
test results accurately reflect the applicant’s aptitude or achievement level
or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the applicant’s impaired sensory,
manual, or speaking skills (except
where those skills are the factors that
the test purports to measure); (ii) admissions tests that are designed for
persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as

often and in as timely a manner as are

the information is being requested on a
voluntary basis, that it will be kept
confidential, that refusal to provide it
will not subject the applicant to any
adverse treatment, and that it will be
used only in accordance with this part.

ensure that such requirements do not
discriminate or have the effect of discriminating, on the basis of handicap,

available in a manner that does not result in discrimination on the basis of
handicap.
§ 104.46 Financial and employment assistance to students.
(a) Provision of financial assistance. (1)
In providing financial assistance to
qualified handicapped persons, a recipient to which this subpart applies may
not,
(i) On the basis of handicap, provide
less assistance than is provided to nonhandicapped persons, limit eligibility
for assistance, or otherwise discriminate or

financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of handicap.
(b) Assistance in making available outside employment.

and athletics and similar aid, benefits,
or services to any of its students, a recipient to which this subpart applies
may not discriminate on the basis of
handicap. A recipient that offers physical education courses or that operates
or sponsors intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide to
qualified handicapped students an
equal opportunity for participation in
these activities.
(2) A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education and
athletic activities that are separate or
different only if separation or differentiation is consistent with the requirements of § 104.43(d) and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied the

or vocational counseling, guidance, or
placement services to its students shall
provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap.
The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not
counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar interests
and abilities. This requirement does
not preclude a recipient from providing
factual information about licensing
and certification requirements that
may present obstacles to handicapped
persons in their pursuit of particular
careers.
(c) Social organizations. A recipient
that provides significant assistance to
fraternities, sororities, or similar organizations shall assure itself that the
membership practices of such organizations do not permit discrimination otherwise prohibited by this subpart.

(a) General. In providing health, welfare, or other social services or benefits, a recipient may not, on the basis
of handicap:
(1) Deny a qualified handicapped person these benefits or services;
(2) Afford a qualified handicapped
person an opportunity to receive benefits or services that is not equal to that
offered nonhandicapped persons;
(3) Provide a qualified handicapped
person with benefits or services that
are not as effective (as defined in
§ 104.4(b)) as the benefits or services
provided to others;
(4) Provide benefits or services in a
manner that limits or has the effect of
limiting the participation of qualified
handicapped persons; or
(5) Provide different or separate benefits or services to handicapped persons
except where necessary to provide
qualified handicapped persons with
benefits and services that are as effective as those provided to others.
(b) Notice. A recipient that provides
notice concerning benefits or services
or written material concerning waivers
of rights or consent to treatment shall
take such steps as are necessary to ensure that qualified handicapped persons, including those with impaired
sensory or speaking skills, are not denied effective notice because of their
handicap.
(c) Emergency treatment for the hearing
impaired. A recipient hospital that provides health services or benefits shall
establish a procedure for effective communication with persons with impaired
hearing for the purpose of providing
emergency health care.

(d) Auxiliary aids. (1) A recipient to
which this subpart applies that employs fifteen or more persons shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids to persons with impaired sensory, manual, or
speaking skills, where necessary to afford such persons an equal opportunity
to benefit from the service in question.
(2) The Assistant Secretary may require recipients with fewer than fifteen
employees to provide auxiliary aids
where the provision of aids would not
significantly impair the ability of the
recipient to provide its benefits or
services.
(3) For the purpose of this paragraph,
auxiliary aids may include brailled and
taped material, interpreters, and other
aids for persons with impaired hearing
or vision.
§ 104.53

Drug and alcohol addicts.

A recipient to which this subpart applies that operates a general hospital
or outpatient facility may not discriminate in admission or treatment
against a drug or alcohol abuser or alcoholic who is suffering from a medical
condition, because of the person’s drug
or alcohol abuse or alcoholism.
§ 104.54 Education of institutionalized
persons.
A recipient to which this subpart applies and that operates or supervises a
program or activity that provides aid,
benefits or services for persons who are
institutionalized because of handicap
shall ensure that each qualified handicapped
person,
as
defined
in
§ 104.3(k)(2), in its program or activity
is provided an appropriate education,
as defined in § 104.33(b). Nothing in this
section shall be interpreted as altering
in any way the obligations of recipients under subpart D.

APPENDIX A TO PART 104—ANALYSIS OF
FINAL REGULATION
SUBPART A—GENERAL PROVISIONS
Definitions—1. Recipient. Section 104.23 contains definitions used throughout the regulation.
One comment requested that the regulation specify that nonpublic elementary and
secondary schools that are not otherwise recipients do not become recipients by virtue
of the fact their students participate in certain federally funded programs. The Secretary believes it unnecessary to amend the
regulation in this regard, because almost
identical language in the Department’s regulations implementing title VI and title IX of
the Education Amendments of 1972 has consistently been interpreted so as not to render
such schools recipients. These schools, however, are indirectly subject to the substantive requirements of this regulation
through the application of § 104.4(b)(iv),
which prohibits recipients from assisting
agencies that discriminate on the basis of
handicap in providing services to beneficiaries of the recipients’ programs.
2. Federal financial assistance. In § 104.3(h),
defining federal financial assistance, a clarifying change has been made: procurement
contracts are specifically excluded. They are
covered, however, by the Department of Labor’s regulation under section 503. The Department has never considered such contracts to be contracts of assistance; the explicit exemption has been added only to
avoid possible confusion.
The proposed regulation’s exemption of
contracts of insurance or guaranty has been
retained. A number of comments argued for
its deletion on the ground that section 504,
unlike title VI and title IX, contains no statutory exemption for such contracts. There is
no indication, however, in the legislative
history of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or
of the amendments to that Act in 1974, that
Congress intended section 504 to have a
broader application, in terms of federal financial assistance, than other civil rights
statutes. Indeed, Congress directed that section 504 be implemented in the same manner
as titles VI and IX. In view of the long established exemption of contracts of insurance or
guaranty under title VI, we think it unlikely
that Congress intended section 504 to apply
to such contracts.
3. Handicapped person. Section 104.3(j),
which defines the class of persons protected
under the regulation, has not been substantially changed. The definition of handicapped person in paragraph (j)(1) conforms to
the statutory definition of handicapped person that is applicable to section 504, as set
forth in section 111(a) of the Rehabilitation
Act Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. 93–516.

The first of the three parts of the statutory
and regulatory definition includes any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more
major life activities. Paragraph (j)(2)(i) further defines physical or mental impairments.
The definition does not set forth a list of specific diseases and conditions that constitute
physical or mental impairments because of
the difficulty of ensuring the comprehensiveness of any such list. The term includes,
however, such diseases and conditions as orthopedic, visual, speech, and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, muscular
dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart
disease, diabetes, mental retardation, emotional illness, and, as discussed below, drug
addiction and alcoholism.
It should be emphasized that a physical or
mental impairment does not constitute a
handicap for purposes of section 504 unless
its severity is such that it results in a substantial limitation of one or more major life
activities. Several comments observed the
lack of any definition in the proposed regulation of the phrase ‘‘substantially limits.’’
The Department does not believe that a definition of this term is possible at this time.
A related issue raised by several comments
is whether the definition of handicapped person is unreasonably broad. Comments suggested narrowing the definition in various
ways. The most common recommendation
was that only ‘‘traditional’’ handicaps be
covered. The Department continues to believe, however, that it has no flexibility
within the statutory definition to limit the
term to persons who have those severe, permanent, or progressive conditions that are
most commonly regarded as handicaps. The
Department intends, however, to give particular attention in its enforcement of section 504 to eliminating discrimination
against persons with the severe handicaps
that were the focus of concern in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
The definition of handicapped person also
includes specific limitations on what persons
are classified as handicapped under the regulation. The first of the three parts of the definition specifies that only physical and mental handicaps are included. Thus, environmental, cultural, and economic disadvantage
are not in themselves covered; nor are prison
records, age, or homosexuality. Of course, if
a person who has any of these characteristics
also has a physical or mental handicap, the
person is included within the definition of
handicapped person.
In paragraph (j)(2)(i), physical or mental
impairment is defined to include, among
other impairments, specific learning disabilities. The Department will interpret the
term as it is used in section 602 of the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended.
Paragraph (15) of section 602 uses the term
‘‘specific learning disabilities’’ to describe

Pt. 104, App. A

such conditions as perceptual handicaps,
brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction,
dyslexia, and developmental aphasia.
Paragraph (j)(2)(i) has been shortened, but
not substantively changed, by the deletion of
clause (C), which made explicit the inclusion
of any condition which is mental or physical
but whose precise nature is not at present
known. Clauses (A) and (B) clearly comprehend such conditions.
The second part of the statutory and regulatory definition of handicapped person includes any person who has a record of a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Under the
definition of ‘‘record’’ in paragraph (j)(2)(iii),
persons who have a history of a handicapping
condition but no longer have the condition,
as well as persons who have been incorrectly
classified as having such a condition, are
protected from discrimination under section
504. Frequently occurring examples of the
first group are persons with histories of mental or emotional illness, heart disease, or
cancer; of the second group, persons who
have been misclassified as mentally retarded.
The third part of the statutory and regulatory definition of handicapped person includes any person who is regarded as having
a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. It includes many persons who are
ordinarily considered to be handicapped but
who do not technically fall within the first
two parts of the statutory definition, such as
persons with a limp. This part of the definition also includes some persons who might
not ordinarily be considered handicapped,
such as persons with disfiguring scars, as
well as persons who have no physical or mental impairment but are treated by a recipient as if they were handicapped.
4. Drug addicts and alcoholics. As was the
case during the first comment period, the
issue of whether to include drug addicts and
alcoholics within the definition of handicapped person was of major concern to many
commenters. The arguments presented on
each side of the issue were similar during the
two comment periods, as was the preference
of commenters for exclusion of this group of
persons. While some comments reflected
misconceptions about the implications of including alcoholics and drug addicts within
the scope of the regulation, the Secretary
understands the concerns that underlie the
comments on this question and recognizes
that application of section 504 to active alcoholics and drug addicts presents sensitive
and difficult questions that must be taken
into account in interpretation and enforcement.
The Secretary has carefully examined the
issue and has obtained a legal opinion from
the Attorney General. That opinion concludes that drug addiction and alcoholism

are ‘‘physical or mental impairments’’ within the meaning of section 7(6) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and that
drug addicts and alcoholics are therefore
handicapped for purposes of section 504 if
their impairment substantially limits one of
their major life activities. The Secretary
therefore believes that he is without authority to exclude these conditions from the definition. There is a medical and legal consensus that alcoholism and drug addiction
are diseases, although there is disagreement
as to whether they are primarily mental or
physical. In addition, while Congress did not
focus specifically on the problems of drug addiction and alcoholism in enacting section
504, the committees that considered the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 were made aware of
the Department’s long-standing practice of
treating addicts and alcoholics as handicapped individuals eligible for rehabilitation
services under the Vocational Rehabilitation
Act.
The Secretary wishes to reassure recipients that inclusion of addicts and alcoholics
within the scope of the regulation will not
lead to the consequences feared by many
commenters. It cannot be emphasized too
strongly that the statute and the regulation
apply only to discrimination against qualified handicapped persons solely by reason of
their handicap. The fact that drug addiction
and alcoholism may be handicaps does not
mean that these conditions must be ignored
in determining whether an individual is
qualified for services or employment opportunities. On the contrary, a recipient may
hold a drug addict or alcoholic to the same
standard of performance and behavior to
which it holds others, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to
the person’s drug addiction or alcoholism. In
other words, while an alcoholic or drug addict may not be denied services or disqualified from employment solely because of his
or her condition, the behavioral manifestations of the condition may be taken into account in determining whether he or she is
qualified.
With respect to the employment of a drug
addict or alcoholic, if it can be shown that
the addiction or alcoholism prevents successful performance of the job, the person
need not be provided the employment opportunity in question. For example, in making
employment decisions, a recipient may judge
addicts and alcoholics on the same basis it
judges all other applicants and employees.
Thus, a recipient may consider—for all applicants including drug addicts and alcoholics—
past personnel records, absenteeism, disruptive, abusive, or dangerous behavior, violations of rules and unsatisfactory work performance. Moreover, employers may enforce
rules prohibiting the possession or use of alcohol or drugs in the work-place, provided

Pt. 104, App. A

that such rules are enforced against all employees.
With respect to other services, the implications of coverage, of alcoholics and drug addicts are two-fold: first, no person may be excluded from services solely by reason of the
presence or history of these conditions; second, to the extent that the manifestations of
the condition prevent the person from meeting the basic eligibility requirements of the
program or cause substantial interference
with the operation of the program, the condition may be taken into consideration.
Thus, a college may not exclude an addict or
alcoholic as a student, on the basis of addiction or alcoholism, if the person can successfully participate in the education program
and complies with the rules of the college
and if his or her behavior does not impede
the performance of other students.
Of great concern to many commenters was
the question of what effect the inclusion of
drug addicts and alcoholics as handicapped
persons would have on school disciplinary
rules prohibiting the use or possession of
drugs or alcohol by students. Neither such
rules nor their application to drug addicts or
alcoholics is prohibited by this regulation,
provided that the rules are enforced evenly
with respect to all students.
5. Qualified handicapped person. Paragraph
(k) of § 104.3 defines the term ‘‘qualified
handicapped person.’’ Throughout the regulation, this term is used instead of the statutory term ‘‘otherwise qualified handicapped
person.’’ The Department believes that the
omission of the word ‘‘otherwise’’ is necessary in order to comport with the intent of
the statute because, read literally, ‘‘otherwise’’ qualified handicapped persons include
persons who are qualified except for their
handicap, rather than in spite of their handicap. Under such a literal reading, a blind person possessing all the qualifications for driving a bus except sight could be said to be
‘‘otherwise qualified’’ for the job of driving.
Clearly, such a result was not intended by
Congress. In all other respects, the terms
‘‘qualified’’ and ‘‘otherwise qualified’’ are intended to be interchangeable.
Section 104.3(k)(1) defines a qualified
handicapped person with respect to employment as a handicapped person who can, with
reasonable accommodation, perform the essential functions of the job in question. The
term ‘‘essential functions’’ does not appear
in the corresponding provision of the Department of Labor’s section 503 regulation, and a
few commenters objected to its inclusion on
the ground that a handicapped person should
be able to perform all job tasks. However,
the Department believes that inclusion of
the phrase is useful in emphasizing that
handicapped persons should not be disqualified simply because they may have difficulty
in performing tasks that bear only a marginal relationship to a particular job. Fur-

ther, we are convinced that inclusion of the
phrase is not inconsistent with the Department of Labor’s application of its definition.
Certain commenters urged that the definition of qualified handicapped person be
amended so as explicitly to place upon the
employer the burden of showing that a particular mental or physical characteristic is
essential. Because the same result is
achieved by the requirement contained in
paragraph (a) of § 104.13, which requires an
employer to establish that any selection criterion that tends to screen out handicapped
persons is job-related, that recommendation
has not been followed.
Section 104.3(k)(2) defines qualified handicapped person, with respect to preschool, elementary, and secondary programs, in terms
of age. Several commenters recommended
that eligibility for the services be based upon
the standard of substantial benefit, rather
than age, because of the need of many handicapped children for early or extended services if they are to have an equal opportunity
to benefit from education programs. No
change has been made in this provision,
again because of the extreme difficulties in
administration that would result from the
choice of the former standard. Under the remedial action provisions of § 104.6(a)(3), however, persons beyond the age limits prescribed in § 104.3(k)(2) may in appropriate
cases be required to be provided services that
they were formerly denied because of a recipient’s violation of section 504.
Section 104.3(k)(2) states that a handicapped person is qualified for preschool, elementary, or secondary services if the person
is of an age at which nonhandicapped persons
are eligible for such services or at which
State law mandates the provision of educational services to handicapped persons. In
addition, the extended age ranges for which
recipients must provide full educational opportunity to all handicapped persons in order
to be eligible for assistance under the Education of the Handicapped Act—generally, 3–
18 as of September 1978, and 3–21 as of September 1980 are incorporated by reference in
this paragraph.
Section 104.3(k)(3) defines qualified handicapped person with respect to postsecondary
educational programs. As revised, the paragraph means that both academic and technical standards must be met by applicants to
these programs. The term technical standards
refers to all nonacademic admissions criteria
that are essential to participation in the program in question.
6. General prohibitions against discrimination.
Section 104.4 contains general prohibitions
against discrimination applicable to all recipients of assistance from this Department.
Paragraph (b)(1(i) prohibits the exclusion
of qualified handicapped persons from aids,
benefits, or services, and paragraph (ii) requires that equal opportunity to participate

Pt. 104, App. A

or benefit be provided. Paragraph (iii) requires that services provided to handicapped
persons be as effective as those provided to
the nonhandicapped. In paragraph (iv), different or separate services are prohibited except when necessary to provide equally effective benefits.
In this context, the term equally effective,
defined in paragraph (b)(2), is intended to encompass the concept of equivalent, as opposed to identical, services and to acknowledge the fact that in order to meet the individual needs of handicapped persons to the
same extent that the corresponding needs of
nonhandicapped persons are met, adjustments to regular programs or the provision
of different programs may sometimes be necessary. This standard parallels the one established under title VI of Civil Rights Act of
1964 with respect to the provision of educational services to students whose primary
language is not English. See Lau v. Nichols,
414 U.S. 563 (1974). To be equally effective,
however, an aid, benefit, or service need not
produce equal results; it merely must afford
an equal opportunity to achieve equal results.
It must be emphasized that, although separate services must be required in some instances, the provision of unnecessarily separate or different services is discriminatory.
The addition to paragraph (b)(2) of the
phrase ‘‘in the most integrated setting appropriated to the person’s needs’’ is intended
to reinforce this general concept. A new
paragraph (b)(3) has also been added to
§ 104.4, requiring recipients to give qualified
handicapped persons the option of participating in regular programs despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs. The requirement has been reiterated
in §§ 104.38 and 104.47 in connection with
physical education and athletics programs.
Section 104.4(b)(1)(v) prohibits a recipient
from supporting another entity or person
that subjects participants or employees in
the recipient’s program to discrimination on
the basis of handicap. This section would, for
example, prohibit financial support by a recipient to a community recreational group
or to a professional or social organization
that discriminates against handicapped persons. Among the criteria to be considered in
each case are the substantiality of the relationship between the recipient and the other
entity, including financial support by the recipient, and whether the other entity’s activities relate so closely to the recipient’s
program or activity that they fairly should
be considered activities of the recipient
itself. Paragraph (b)(1)(vi) was added in response to comment in order to make explicit
the prohibition against denying qualified
handicapped persons the opportunity to
serve on planning and advisory boards responsible for guiding federally assisted programs or activities.

Several comments appeared to interpret
§ 104.4(b)(5), which proscribes discriminatory
site selection, to prohibit a recipient that is
located on hilly terrain from erecting any
new buildings at its present site. That, of
course, is not the case. This paragraph is not
intended to apply to construction of additional buildings at an existing site. Of
course, any such facilities must be made accessible in accordance with the requirements
of § 104.23.
7. Assurances of compliance. Section 104.5(a)
requires a recipient to submit to the Assistant Secretary an assurance that each of its
programs and activities receiving or benefiting from Federal financial assistance from
this Department will be conducted in compliance with this regulation. Many commenters also sought relief from the paperwork requirements imposed by the Department’s enforcement of its various civil rights
responsibilities by requesting the Department to issue one form incorporating title
VI, title IX, and section 504 assurances. The
Secretary is sympathetic to this request.
While it is not feasible to adopt a single civil
rights assurance form at this time, the Office
for Civil Rights will work toward that goal.
8. Private rights of action. Several comments urged that the regulation incorporate
provision granting beneficiaries a private
right of action against recipients under section 504. To confer such a right is beyond the
authority of the executive branch of Government. There is, however, case law holding
that such a right exists. Lloyd v. Regional
Transportation Authority, 548 F. 2d 1277 (7th
Cir. 1977); see Hairston v. Drosick, Civil No. 75–
0691 (S.D. W. Va., Jan. 14, 1976); Gurmankin v.
Castanzo, 411 F. Supp. 982 (E.D. Pa. 1976); cf.
Lau v. Nichols, supra.
9. Remedial action. Where there has been a
finding of discrimination, § 104.6 requires a
recipient to take remedial action to overcome the effects of the discrimination. Actions that might be required under paragraph (a)(1) include provision of services to
persons previously discriminated against, reinstatement of employees and development
of a remedial action plan. Should a recipient
fail to take required remedial action, the ultimate sanctions of court action or termination of Federal financial assistance may
be imposed.
Paragraph (a)(2) extends the responsibility
for taking remedial action to a recipient
that exercises control over a noncomplying
recipient. Paragraph (a)(3) also makes clear
that handicapped persons who are not in the
program at the time that remedial action is
required to be taken may also be the subject
of such remedial action. This paragraph has
been revised in response to comments in
order to include persons who would have
been in the program if discriminatory practices had not existed. Paragraphs (a) (1), (2),
and (3) have also been amended in response

to comments to make plain that, in appropriate cases, remedial action might be required to redress clear violations of the statute itself that occurred before the effective
date of this regulation.
10. Voluntary action. In § 104.6(b), the term
‘‘voluntary action’’ has been substituted for
the term ‘‘affirmative action’’ because the
use of the latter term led to some confusion.
We believe the term ‘‘voluntary action’’
more accurately reflects the purpose of the
paragraph. This provision allows action, beyond that required by the regulation, to
overcome conditions that led to limited participation by handicapped persons, whether
or not the limited participation was caused
by any discriminatory actions on the part of
the recipient. Several commenters urged
that paragraphs (a) and (b) be revised to require remedial action to overcome effects of
prior discriminatory practices regardless of
whether there has been an express finding of
discrimination. The self-evaluation requirement in paragraph (c) accomplishes much
the same purpose.
11. Self-evaluation. Paragraph (c) requires
recipients to conduct a self-evaluation in
order to determine whether their policies or
practices may discriminate against handicapped persons and to take steps to modify
any discriminatory policies and practices
and their effects. The Department received
many comments approving of the addition to
paragraph (c) of a requirement that recipients seek the assistance of handicapped persons in the self-evaluation process. This
paragraph has been further amended to require consultation with handicapped persons
or organizations representing them before
recipients undertake the policy modifications and remedial steps prescribed in paragraphs (c) (ii) and (iii).
Paragraph (c)(2), which sets forth the recordkeeping requirements concerning selfevaluation, now applies only to recipients
with fifteen or more employees. This change
was made as part of an effort to reduce unnecessary or counterproductive administrative obligations on small recipients. For
those recipients required to keep records, the
requirements have been made more specific;
records must include a list of persons consulted and a description of areas examined,
problems identified, and corrective steps
taken. Moreover, the records must be made
available for public inspection.
12. Grievance procedure. Section 104.7 requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to designate an individual responsible for coordinating its compliance efforts
and to adopt a grievance procedure. Two
changes were made in the section in response
to comment. A general requirement that appropriate due process procedures be followed
has been added. It was decided that the details of such procedures could not at this
time be specified because of the varied na-

ture of the persons and entities who must establish the procedures and of the programs
to which they apply. A sentence was also
added to make clear that grievance procedures are not required to be made available
to unsuccessful applicants for employment
or to applicants for admission to colleges
and universities.
The regulation does not require that grievance procedures be exhausted before recourse
is sought from the Department. However, the
Secretary believes that it is desirable and efficient in many cases for complainants to
seek resolution of their complaints and disputes at the local level and therefore encourages them to use available grievance procedures.
A number of comments asked whether
compliance with this section or the notice
requirements of § 104.8 could be coordinated
with comparable action required by the title
IX regulation. The Department encourages
such efforts.
13. Notice. Section 104.8 (formerly § 84.9)
sets forth requirements for dissemination of
statements of nondicrimination policy by recipients.
It is important that both handicapped persons and the public at large be aware of the
obligations of recipients under section 504.
Both the Department and recipients have responsibilities in this regard. Indeed the Department intends to undertake a major public information effort to inform persons of
their rights under section 504 and this regulation. In § 104.8 the Department has sought
to impose a clear obligation on major recipients to notify beneficiaries and employees of
the requirements of section 504, without dictating the precise way in which this notice
must be given. At the same time, we have
avoided imposing requirements on small recipients (those with fewer than fifteen employees) that would create unnecessary and
counterproductive paper work burdens on
them and unduly stretch the enforcement resources of the Department.
Section 104.8(a), as simplified, requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to
take appropriate steps to notify beneficiaries
and employees of the recipient’s obligations
under section 504. The last sentence of
§ 104.8(a) has been revised to list possible,
rather than required, means of notification.
Section 104.8(b) requires recipients to include
a notification of their policy of nondiscrimination in recruitment and other general information materials.
In response to a number of comments,
§ 104.8 has been revised to delete the requirements of publication in local newspapers,
which has proved to be both troublesome and
ineffective. Several commenters suggested
that notification on separate forms be allowed until present stocks of publications
and forms are depleted. The final regulation
explicitly allows this method of compliance.

Pt. 104, App. A

The separate form should, however, be included with each significant publication or
form that is distributed.
Section 104 which prohibited the use of materials that might give the impression that a
recipient excludes qualified handicapped persons from its program, has been deleted. The
Department is convinced by the comments
that this provision is unnecessary and difficult to apply. The Department encourages
recipients, however, to include in their recruitment and other general information
materials photographs of handicapped persons and ramps and other features of accessible buildings.
Under new § 104.9 the Assistant Secretary
may, under certain circumstances, require
recipients with fewer than fifteen employees
to comply with one or more of these requirements. Thus, if experience shows a need for
imposing notice or other requirements on
particular recipients or classes of small recipients, the Department is prepared to expand the coverage of these sections.
14. Inconsistent State laws. Section 104.10(a)
states that compliance with the regulation is
not excused by State or local laws limiting
the eligibility of qualified handicapped persons to receive services or to practice an occupation. The provision thus applies only
with respect to state or local laws that
unjustifiably differentiate on the basis of
handicap.
Paragraph (b) further points out that the
presence of limited employment opportunities in a particular profession, does not excuse a recipient from complying with the
regulation. Thus, a law school could not
deny admission to a blind applicant because
blind laywers may find it more difficult to
find jobs than do nonhandicapped lawyers.
SUBPART B—EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES
Subpart B prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in the employment practices
of recipients of Federal financial assistance
administered by the Department. This subpart is consistent with the employment provisions of the Department’s regulation implementing title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (34 CFR, part 106) and the regulation of the Department of Labor under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, which
requries certain Federal contractors to take
affirmative action in the employment and
advancement of qualified handicapped persons. All recipients subject to title IX are
also subject to this regulation. In addition,
many recipients subject to this regulation
receive Federal procurement contracts in excess of $2,500 and are therefore also subject
to section 503.
15. Discriminatory practices. Section 104.11
sets forth general provisions with respect to
discrimination in employment. A new paragraph (a)(2) has been added to clarify the employment obligations of recipients that re-

ceive Federal funds under Part B of the Education of the Handicapped Act, as amended
(EHA). Section 606 of the EHA obligates elementary or secondary school systems that
receive EHA funds to take positive steps to
employ and advance in employment qualified
handicapped persons. This obligation is similar to the nondiscrimination requirement of
section 504 but requires recipients to take
additional steps to hire and promote handicapped persons. In enacting section 606 Congress chose the words ‘‘positive steps’’ instead of ‘‘affirmative action’’ advisedly and
did not intend section 606 to incorporate the
types of activities required under Executive
Order 11246 (affirmative action on the basis
of race, color, sex, or national origin) or
under sections 501 and 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Paragraph (b) of § 104.11 sets forth the specific aspects of employment covered by the
regulation. Paragraph (c) provides that inconsistent provisions of collective bargaining agreements do not excuse noncompliance.
16. Reasonable accommodation. The reasonable accommodation requirement of § 104.12
generated a substantial number of comments. The Department remains convinced
that its approach is both fair and effective.
Moreover, the Department of Labor reports
that it has experienced little difficulty in administering the requirements of reasonable
accommodation. The provision therefore remains basically unchanged from the proposed regulation.
Section 104.12 requires a recipient to make
reasonable accommodation to the known
physical or mental limitations of a handicapped applicant or employee unless the recipient can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on
the operation of its program. Where a handicapped person is not qualified to perform a
particular job, where reasonable accommodation does not overcome the effects of a
person’s handicap, or where reasonable accommodation causes undue hardship to the
employer, failure to hire or promote the
handicapped person will not be considered
discrimination.
Section 104.12(b) lists some of the actions
that constitute reasonable accommodation.
The list is neither all-inclusive nor meant to
suggest that employers must follow all of
the actions listed.
Reasonable accommodation includes modification of work schedules, including parttime employment, and job restructuring. Job
restructuring may entail shifting nonessential duties to other employees. In other
cases, reasonable accommodation may include physical modifications or relocation of
particular offices or jobs so that they are in
facilities or parts of facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
If such accommodations would cause undue

34 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)

hardship to the employer, they need not be
made.
Paragraph (c) of this section sets forth the
factors that the Office for Civil Rights will
consider in determining whether an accommodation necessary to enable an applicant
or employee to perform the duties of a job
would impose an undue hardship. The weight
given to each of these factors in making the
determination as to whether an accommodation constitutes undue hardship will vary depending on the facts of a particular situation. Thus, a small day-care center might
not be required to expend more than a nominal sum, such as that necessary to equip a
telephone for use by a secretary with impaired hearing, but a large school district
might be required to make available a teacher’s aide to a blind applicant for a teaching
job. The reasonable accommodation standard
in § 104.12 is similar to the obligation imposed upon Federal contractors in the regulation implementing section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, administered by the
Department of Labor. Although the wording
of the reasonable accommodation provisions
of the two regulations is not identical, the
obligation that the two regulations impose is
the same, and the Federal Government’s policy in implementing the two sections will be
uniform. The Department adopted the factors listed in paragraph (c) instead of the
‘‘business necessity’’ standard of the Labor
regulation because that term seemed inappropriate to the nature of the programs operated by the majority of institutions subject
to this regulation, e.g., public school systems, colleges and universities. The factors
listed in paragraph (c) are intended to make
the rationale underlying the business necessity standard applicable to an understandable by recipients of ED funds.
17. Tests and selection criteria. Revised
§ 104.13(a) prohibits employers from using
test or other selection criteria that screen
out or tend to screen out handicapped persons unless the test or criterion is shown to
be job-related and alternative tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen
out as many handicapped persons are not
shown by the Assistant Secretary to be
available. This paragraph is an application of
the principle established under title VII of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in Griggs v. Duke
Power Company, 401 U.S. 424 (1971).
Under the proposed section, a statistical
showing of adverse impact on handicapped
persons was required to trigger an employer’s obligation to show that employment criteria and qualifications relating to handicap
were necessary. This requirement was
changed because the small number of handicapped persons taking tests would make statistical showings of ‘‘disproportionate, adverse effect’’ difficult and burdensome.
Under the altered, more workable provision,
once it is shown that an employment test

substantially limits the opportunities of
handicapped persons, the employer must
show the test to be job-related. A recipient is
no longer limited to using predictive validity
studies as the method for demonstrating
that a test or other selection criterion is in
fact job-related. Nor, in all cases, are predictive validity studies sufficient to demonstrate that a test or criterion is job-related. In addition, § 104.13(a) has been revised
to place the burden on the Assistant Secretary, rather than the recipient, to identify
alternate tests.
Section 104.13(b) requires that a recipient
take into account that some tests and criteria depend upon sensory, manual, or speaking skills that may not themselves be necessary to the job in question but that may
make the handicapped person unable to pass
the test. The recipient must select and administer tests so as best to ensure that the
test will measure the handicapped person’s
ability to perform on the job rather than the
person’s ability to see, hear, speak, or perform manual tasks, except, of course, where
such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure. For example, a person with
a speech impediment may be perfectly qualified for jobs that do not or need not, with
reasonable accommodation, require ability
to speak clearly. Yet, if given an oral test,
the person will be unable to perform in a satisfactory manner. The test results will not,
therefore, predict job performance but instead will reflect impaired speech.
18. Preemployment inquiries. Section 104.14,
concerning preemployment inquiries, generated a large number of comments. Commenters representing handicapped persons
strongly favored a ban on preemployment inquiries on the ground that such inquiries are
often used to discriminate against handicapped persons and are not necessary to
serve any legitimate interests of employers.
Some recipients, on the other hand, argued
that preemployment inquiries are necessary
to determine qualifications of the applicant,
safety hazards caused by a particular handicapping condition, and accommodations that
might be required.
The Secretary has concluded that a general prohibition of preemployment inquiries
is appropriate. However, a sentence has been
added to paragraph (a) to make clear that an
employer may inquire into an applicant’s
ability to perform job-related tasks but may
not ask if the person has a handicap. For example, an employer may not ask on an employment form if an applicant is visually impaired but may ask if the person has a current driver’s license (if that is a necessary
qualification for the position in question).
Similarly, employers may make inquiries
about an applicant’s ability to perform a job
safely. Thus, an employer may not ask if an

Pt. 104, App. A

applicant is an epileptic but may ask whether the person can perform a particular job
without endangering other employees.
Section 104.14(b) allows preemployment inquiries only if they are made in conjunction
with required remedial action to correct past
discrimination, with voluntary action to
overcome past conditions that have limited
the participation of handicapped persons, or
with obligations under section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In these instances,
paragraph (b) specifies certain safeguards
that must be followed by the employer.
Finally, the revised provision allows an
employer to condition offers of employment
to handicapped persons on the results of
medical examinations, so long as the examinations are administered to all employees in
a nondiscriminatory manner and the results
are treated on a confidential basis.
19. Specific acts of Discrimination. Sections
104.15 (recruitment), 104.16 (compensation),
104.17 (job classification and structure) and
104.18 (fringe benefits) have been deleted
from the regulation as unnecessarily duplicative of § 104.11 (discrimination prohibited).
The deletion of these sections in no way
changes the substantive obligations of employers subject to this regulation from those
set forth in the July 16 proposed regulation.
These deletions bring the regulation closer
in form to the Department of Labor’s section
503 regulation.
A proposed section, concerning fringe benefits, had allowed for differences in benefits or
contributions between handicapped and nonhandicapped persons in situations only
where such differences could be justified on
an actuarial basis. Section 104.11 simply bars
discrimination in providing fringe benefits
and does not address the issue of actuarial
differences. The Department believes that
currently available data and experience do
not demonstrate a basis for promulgating a
regulation specifically allowing for differences in benefits or contributions.
SUBPART C—PROGRAM ACCESSIBILITY
In general, Subpart C prohibits the exclusion of qualified handicapped persons from
federally assisted programs or activities because a recipient’s facilities are inaccessible
or unusable.
20. Existing facilities. Section 104.22 maintains the same standard for nondiscrimination in regard to existing facilities as was included in the proposed regulation. The section states that a recipients program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, must be
readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. Paragraphs (a) and (b) make
clear that a recipient is not required to
make each of its existing facilities accessible
to handicapped persons if its program as a
whole is accessible. Accessibility to the recipient’s program or activity may be
achieved by a number of means, including re-

design of equipment, reassignment of classes
or other services to accessible buildings, and
making aides available to beneficiaries. In
choosing among methods of compliance, recipients are required to give priority consideration to methods that will be consistent
with provision of services in the most appropriate integrated setting. Structural changes
in existing facilities are required only where
there is no other feasible way to make the
recipient’s program accessible.
Under § 104.22, a university does not have to
make all of its existing classroom buildings
accessible to handicapped students if some of
its buildings are already accessible and if it
is possible to reschedule or relocate enough
classes so as to offer all required courses and
a reasonable selection of elective courses in
accessible facilities. If sufficient relocation
of classes is not possible using existing facilities, enough alterations to ensure program accessibility are required. A university
may not exclude a handicapped student from
a specifically requested course offering because it is not offered in an accessible location, but it need not make every section of
that course accessible.
Commenters representing several institutions of higher education have suggested
that it would be appropriate for one postsecondary institution in a geographical area to
be made accessible to handicapped persons
and for other colleges and universities in
that area to participate in that school’s program, thereby developing an educational
consortium for the postsecondary education
of handicapped students. The Department believes that such a consortium, when developed and applied only to handicapped persons, would not constitute compliance with
§ 104.22, but would discriminate against
qualified handicapped persons by restricting
their choice in selecting institutions of higher education and would, therefore, be inconsistent with the basic objectives of the statute.
Nothing in this regulation, however,
should be read as prohibiting institutions
from forming consortia for the benefit of all
students. Thus, if three colleges decide that
it would be cost-efficient for one college to
offer biology, the second physics, and the
third chemistry to all students at the three
colleges, the arrangement would not violate
section 504. On the other hand, it would violate the regulation if the same institutions
set up a consortium under which one college
undertook to make its biology lab accessible, another its physics lab, and a third its
chemistry lab, and under which mobility-impaired handicapped students (but not other
students) were required to attend the particular college that is accessible for the desired courses.
Similarly, while a public school district
need not make each of its buildings completely accessible, it may not make only one

facility or part of a facility accessible if the
result is to segregate handicapped students
in a single setting.
All recipients that provide health, welfare,
or other social services may also comply
with § 104.22 by delivering services at alternate accessible sites or making home visits.
Thus, for example, a pharmacist might arrange to make home deliveries of drugs.
Under revised § 104.22(c), small providers of
health, welfare, and social services (those
with fewer than fifteen employees) may refer
a beneficiary to an accessible provider of the
desired service, but only if no means of meeting the program accessibility requirement
other than a significant alteration in existing facilities is available. The referring recipient has the responsibility of determining
that the other provider is in fact accessible
and willing to provide the service.
A recent change in the tax law may assist
some recipients in meeting their obligations
under this section. Under section 2122 of the
Tax Reform Act of 1976, recipients that pay
federal income tax are eligible to claim a tax
deduction of up to $25,000 for architectural
and transportation modifications made to
improve accessibility for handicapped persons. See 42 FR 17870 (April 4, 1977), adopting
26 CFR 7.190.
Several commenters expressed concern
about the feasibility of compliance with the
program accessibility standard. The Secretary believes that the standard is flexible
enough to permit recipients to devise ways
to make their programs accessible short of
extremely expensive or impractical physical
changes in facilities. Accordingly, the section does not allow for waivers. The Department is ready at all times to provide technical assistance to recipients in meeting
their program accessibility responsibilities.
For this purpose, the Department is establishing a special technical assistance unit.
Recipients are encouraged to call upon the
unit staff for advice and guidance both on
structural modifications and on other ways
of meeting the program accessibility requirement.
Paragraph (d) has been amended to require
recipients to make all nonstructural adjustments necessary for meeting the program accessibility standard within sixty days. Only
where structural changes in facilities are
necessary will a recipient be permitted up to
three years to accomplish program accessibility. It should be emphasized that the
three-year time period is not a waiting period and that all changes must be accomplished as expeditiously as possible. Further,
it is the Department’s belief, after consultation with experts in the field, that outside
ramps to buildings can be constructed quickly and at relatively low cost. Therefore, it
will be expected that such structural additions will be made promptly to comply with
§ 104.22(d).

The regulation continues to provide, as did
the proposed version, that a recipient planning to achieve program accessibility by
making structural changes must develop a
transition plan for such changes within six
months of the effective date of the regulation. A number of commenters suggested extending that period to one year. The secretary believes that such an extension is unnecessary and unwise. Planning for any necessary structural changes should be undertaken promptly to ensure that they can be
completed within the three-year period. The
elements of the transition plan as required
by the regulation remain virtually unchanged from the proposal but § 104.22(d) now
includes a requirement that the recipient
make the plan available for public inspection.
Several commenters expressed concern
that the program accessibility standard
would result in the segregation of handicapped persons in educational institutions.
The regulation will not be applied to permit
such a result. See § 104.4(c)(2)(iv), prohibiting
unnecessarily separate treatment; § 104.35,
requiring that students in elementary and
secondary schools be educated in the most
integrated setting appropriate to their
needs; and new § 104.43(d), applying the same
standard to postsecondary education.
We have received some comments from organizations of handicapped persons on the
subject of requiring, over an extended period
of time, a barrier-free environment—that is,
requiring the removal of all architectural
barriers in existing facilities. The Department has considered these comments but has
decided to take no further action at this
time concerning these suggestions, believing
that such action should only be considered in
light of experience in implementing the program accessibility standard.
21. New construction. Section 104.23 requires
that all new facilities, as well as alterations
that could affect access to and use of existing facilities, be designed and constructed in
a manner so as to make the facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.
Section 104.23(a) has been amended so that it
applies to each newly constructed facility if
the construction was commenced after the
effective date of the regulation. The words
‘‘if construction has commenced’’ will be
considered to mean ‘‘if groundbreaking has
taken place.’’ Thus, a recipient will not be
required to alter the design of a facility that
has progressed beyond groundbreaking prior
to the effective date of the regulation.
Paragraph (b) requires certain alterations
to conform to the requirement of physical
accessibility in paragraph (a). If an alteration is undertaken to a portion of a building the accessibility of which could be improved by the manner in which the alteration is carried out, the alteration must be
made in that manner. Thus, if a doorway or

wall is being altered, the door or other wall
opening must be made wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs. On the other hand,
if the alteration consists of altering ceilings,
the provisions of this section are not applicable because this alteration cannot be done in
a way that affects the accessibility of that
portion of the building. The phrase ‘‘to the
maximum extent feasible’’ has been added to
allow for the occasional case in which the
nature of an existing facility is such as to
make it impractical or prohibitively expensive to renovate the building in a manner
that results in its being entirely barrier-free.
In all such cases, however, the alteration
should provide the maximum amount of
physical accessibility feasible.
Section 104.23(d) of the proposed regulation, providing for a limited deferral of action concerning facilities that are subject to
section 502 as well as section 504 of the Act,
has been deleted. The Secretary believes that
the provision is unnecessary and inappropriate to this regulation. The Department
will, however, seek to coordinate enforcement activities under this regulation with
those of the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board.
SUBPART D—PRESCHOOL, ELEMENTARY, AND
SECONDARY EDUCATION
Subpart D sets forth requirements for nondiscrimination in preschool, elementary, secondary, and adult education programs and
activities, including secondary vocational
education programs. In this context, the
term ‘‘adult education’’ refers only to those
educational programs and activities for
adults that are operated by elementary and
secondary schools.
The provisions of Subpart D apply to state
and local educational agencies. Although the
subpart applies, in general, to both public
and private education programs and activities that are federally assisted, §§ 104.32 and
104.33 apply only to public programs and
§ 104.39 applies only to private programs;
§§ 104.35 and 104.36 apply both to public programs and to those private programs that include special services for handicapped students.
Subpart B generally conforms to the standards established for the education of handicapped persons in Mills v. Board of Education
of the District of Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866
(D.D.C. 1972), Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 344 F. Supp. 1257 (E.D. 1971), 343 F.
Supp. 279 (E.D. Pa. 1972), and Lebanks v.
Spears, 60, F.R.D. 135 (E.D. La. 1973), as well
as in the Education of the Handicapped Act,
as amended by Pub. L. 94–142 (the EHA).
The basic requirements common to those
cases, to the EHA, and to this regulation are
(1) that handicapped persons, regardless of
the nature or severity of their handicap, be
provided a free appropriate public education,

(2) that handicapped students be educated
with nonhandicapped students to the maximum extent appropriate to their needs, (3)
that educational agencies undertake to identify and locate all unserved handicapped
children, (4) that evaluation procedures be
improved in order to avoid the inappropriate
education
that
results
from
the
misclassification of students, and (5) that
procedural safeguard be established to enable parents and guardians to influence decisions regarding the evaluation and placement of their children. These requirements
are designed to ensure that no handicapped
child is excluded from school on the basis of
handicap and, if a recipient demonstrates
that placement in a regular educational setting cannot be achieved satisfactorily, that
the student is provided with adequate alternative services suited to the student’s needs
without additional cost to the student’s parents or guardian. Thus, a recipient that operates a public school system must either educate handicapped children in its regular program or provide such children with an appropriate alternative education at public expense.
It is not the intention of the Department,
except in extraordinary circumstances, to review the result of individual placement and
other educational decisions, so long as the
school district complies with the ‘‘process’’
requirements of this subpart (concerning
identification and location, evaluation, and
due process procedures). However, the Department will place a high priority on investigating cases which may involve exclusion
of a child from the education system or a
pattern or practice of discriminatory placements or education.
22. Location and notification. Section 104.32
requires public schools to take steps annually to identify and locate handicapped children who are not receiving an education and
to publicize to handicapped children and
their parents the rights and duties established by section 504 and this regulation.
This section has been shortened without substantive change.
23. Free appropriate public education. Under
§ 104.33(a), a recipient is responsible for providing a free appropriate public education to
each qualified handicapped person who is in
the recipient’s jurisdiction. The word ‘‘in’’
encompasses the concepts of both domicile
and actual residence. If a recipient places a
child in a program other than its own, it remains financially responsible for the child,
whether or not the other program is operated by another recipient or educational
agency. Moreover, a recipient may not place
a child in a program that is inappropriate or
that otherwise violates the requirements of
Subpart D. And in no case may a recipient
refuse to provide services to a handicapped
child in its jurisdiction because of another

34 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)

person’s or entity’s failure to assume financial responsibility.
Section 104.33(b) concerns the provision of
appropriate educational services to handicapped children. To be appropriate, such
services must be designed to meet handicapped children’s individual educational
needs to the same extent that those of nonhandicapped children are met. An appropriate education could consist of education
in regular classes, education in regular classes with the use of supplementary services, or
special education and related services. Special education may include specially designed instruction in classrooms, at home, or
in private or public institutions and may be
accompanied by such related services as developmental, corrective, and other supportive services (including psychological,
counseling, and medical diagnostic services).
The placement of the child must however, be
consistent with the requirements of § 104.34
and be suited to his or her educational needs.
The quality of the educational services
provided to handicapped students must equal
that of the services provided to nonhandicapped students; thus, handicapped student’s
teachers must be trained in the instruction
of persons with the handicap in question and
appropriate materials and equipment must
be available. The Department is aware that
the supply of adequately trained teachers
may, at least at the outset of the imposition
of this requirement, be insufficient to meet
the demand of all recipients. This factor will
be considered in determining the appropriateness of the remedy for noncompliance
with this section. A new § 104.33(b)(2) has
been added, which allows this requirement to
be met through the full implementation of
an individualized education program developed in accordance with the standards of the
EHA.
Paragraph (c) of § 104.33 sets forth the specific financial obligations of a recipient. If a
recipient does not itself provide handicapped
persons with the requisite services, it must
assume the cost of any alternate placement.
If, however, a recipient offers adequate services and if alternate placement is chosen by
a student’s parent or guardian, the recipient
need not assume the cost of the outside services. (If the parent or guardian believes that
his or her child cannot be suitably educated
in the recipient’s program, he or she may
make use of the procedures established in
§ 104.36.) Under this paragraph, a recipient’s
obligation extends beyond the provision of
tuition payments in the case of placement
outside the regular program. Adequate
transportation must also be provided. Recipients must also pay for psychological
services and those medical services necessary for diagnostic and evaluative purposes.
If the recipient places a student, because of
his or her handicap, in a program that neces-

sitates his or her being away from home, the
payments must also cover room and board
and nonmedical care (including custodial
and supervisory care). When residential care
is necessitated not by the student’s handicap
but by factors such as the student’s home
conditions, the recipient is not required to
pay the cost of room and board.
Two new sentences have been added to
paragraph (c)(1) to make clear that a recipient’s financial obligations need not be met
solely through its own funds. Recipients may
rely on funds from any public or private
source including insurers and similar third
parties.
The EHA requires a free appropriate education to be provided to handicapped children ‘‘no later than September 1, 1978,’’ but
section 504 contains no authority for delaying enforcement. To resolve this problem, a
new paragraph (d) has been added to § 104.33.
Section 104.33(d) requires recipients to
achieve full compliance with the free appropriate public education requirements of
§ 104.33 as expeditiously as possible, but in no
event later than September 1, 1978. The provision also makes clear that, as of the effective date of this regulation, no recipient may
exclude a qualified handicapped child from
its educational program. This provision
against exclusion is consistent with the
order of providing services set forth in section 612(3) of the EHA, which places the highest priority on providing services to handicapped children who are not receiving an
education.
24. Educational setting. Section 104.34 prescribes standards for educating handicapped
persons with nonhandicapped persons to the
maximum extent appropriate to the needs of
the handicapped person in question. A handicapped student may be removed from the
regular educational setting only where the
recipient can show that the needs of the student would, on balance, be served by placement in another setting.
Although under § 104.34, the needs of the
handicapped person are determinative as to
proper placement, it should be stressed that,
where a handicapped student is so disruptive
in a regular classroom that the education of
other students is significantly impaired, the
needs of the handicapped child cannot be met
in that environment. Therefore, regular
placement would not be appropriate to his or
her needs and would not be required by
§ 104.34.
Among the factors to be considered in placing a child is the need to place the child as
close to home as possible. A new sentence
has been added to paragraph (a) requiring recipients to take this factor into account. As
pointed out in several comments, the parents’ right under § 104.36 to challenge the
placement of their child extends not only to
placement in special classes or separate
schools but also to placement in a distant

school and, in particular, to residential
placement. An equally appropriate educational program may exist closer to home;
this issue may be raised by the parent or
guardian under §§ 104.34 and 104.36.
New paragraph (b) specified that handicapped children must also be provided nonacademic services in as integrated a setting
as possible. This requirement is especially
important for children whose educational
needs necessitate their being solely with
other handicapped children during most of
each day. To the maximum extent appropriate, children in residential settings are
also to be provided opportunities for participation with other children.
Section 104.34(c) requires that any facilities that are identifiable as being for handicapped students be comparable in quality to
other facilities of the recipient. A number of
comments objected to this section on the
basis that it encourages the creation and
maintenance of such facilities. This is not
the intent of the provision. A separate facility violates section 504 unless it is indeed
necessary to the provision of an appropriate
education to certain handicapped students.
In those instances in which such facilities
are necessary (as might be the case, for example, for severely retarded persons), this
provision requires that the educational services provided be comparable to those provided in the facilities of the recipient that
are not identifiable as being for handicapped
persons.
25. Evaluation and placement. Because the
failure to provide handicapped persons with
an appropriate education is so frequently the
result of misclassification or misplacement,
§ 104.33(b)(1) makes compliance with its provisions contingent upon adherence to certain
procedures designed to ensure appropriate
classification and placement. These procedures, delineated in §§ 104.35 and 104.36, are
concerned with testing and other evaluation
methods and with procedural due process
rights.
Section 104.35(a) requires that an individual evaluation be conducted before any
action is taken with respect either to the
initial placement of a handicapped child in a
regular or special education program or to
any subsequent significant change in that
placement. Thus, a full reevaluation is not
required every time an adjustment in placement is made. ‘‘Any action’’ includes denials
of placement.
Paragraphs (b) and (c) of § 104.35 establishes
procedures designed to ensure that children
are not misclassified, unnecessarily labeled
as being handicapped, or incorrectly placed
because of inappropriate selection, administration, or interpretation of evaluation materials. This problem has been extensively
documented in ‘‘Issues in the Classification
of Children,’’ a report by the Project on Classification of Exceptional Children, in which

the HEW Interagency Task Force participated. The provisions of these paragraphs are
aimed primarily at abuses in the placement
process that result from misuse of, or undue
or misplaced reliance on, standardized scholastic aptitude tests.
Paragraph (b) has been shortened but not
substantively changed. The requirement in
former subparagraph (1) that recipients provide and administer evaluation materials in
the native language of the student has been
deleted as unnecessary, since the same requirement already exists under title VI and
is more appropriately covered under that
statute. Paragraphs (1) and (2) are, in general, intended to prevent misinterpretation
and similar misuse of test scores and, in particular, to avoid undue reliance on general
intelligence tests. Subparagraph (3) requires
a recipient to administer tests to a student
with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking
skills in whatever manner is necessary to
avoid distortion of the test results by the
impairment. Former subparagraph (4) has
been deleted as unnecessarily repetitive of
the other provisions of this paragraph.
Paragraph (c) requires a recipient to draw
upon a variety of sources in the evaluation
process so that the possibility of error in
classification is minimized. In particular, it
requires that all significant factors relating
to the learning process, including adaptive
behavior, be considered. (Adaptive behavior
is the effectiveness with which the individual meets the standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected
of his or her age and cultural group.) Information from all sources must be documented
and considered by a group of persons, and the
procedure must ensure that the child is
placed in the most integrated setting appropriate.
The proposed regulation would have required a complete individual reevaluation of
the student each year. The Department has
concluded that it is inappropriate in the section 504 regulation to require full reevaluations on such a rigid schedule. Accordingly,
§ 104.35(c) requires periodic reevaluations and
specifies that reevaluations in accordance
with the EHA will constitute compliance.
The proposed regulation implementing the
EHA allows reevaluation at three-year intervals except under certain specified circumstances.
Under § 104.36, a recipient must establish a
system of due process procedures to be afforded to parents or guardians before the recipient takes any action regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of a person who, because of handicap,
needs or is believed to need special education
or related services. This section has been revised. Because the due process procedures of
the EHA, incorporated by reference in the
proposed section 504 regulation, are inappropriate for some recipients not subject to that

Act, the section now specifies minimum necessary procedures: notice, a right to inspect
records, an impartial hearing with a right to
representation by counsel, and a review procedure. The EHA procedures remain one
means of meeting the regulation’s due process requirements, however, and are recommended to recipients as a model.
26. Nonacademic services. Section 104.37 requires a recipient to provide nonacademic
and extracurricular services and activities in
such manner as is necessary to afford handicapped students an equal opportunity for
participation. Because these services and activities are part of a recipient’s education
program, they must, in accordance with the
provisions of § 104.34, be provided in the most
integrated setting appropriate.
Revised paragraph (c)(2) does permit separation or differentiation with respect to the
provision of physical education and athletics
activities, but only if qualified handicapped
students are also allowed the opportunity to
compete for regular teams or participate in
regular activities. Most handicapped students are able to participate in one or more
regular physical education and athletics activities. For example, a student in a wheelchair can participate in regular archery
course, as can a deaf student in a wrestling
course.
Finally, the one-year transition period provided in a proposed section was deleted in response to the almost unanimous objection of
commenters to that provision.
27. Preschool and adult education. Section
104.38 prohibits discrimination on the basis
of handicap in preschool and adult education
programs. Former paragraph (b), which emphasized that compensatory programs for
disadvantaged children are subject to section
504, has been deleted as unnecessary, since it
is comprehended by paragraph (a).
28. Private education. Section 104.39 sets
forth the requirements applicable to recipients that operate private education programs and activities. The obligations of
these recipients have been changed in two
significant respects: first, private schools are
subject to the evaluation and due process
provisions of the subpart only if they operate
special education programs; second, under
§ 104.39(b), they may charge more for providing services to handicapped students than
to nonhandicapped students to the extent
that additional charges can be justified by
increased costs.
Paragraph (a) of § 104.39 is intended to
make clear that recipients that operate private education programs and activities are
not required to provide an appropriate education to handicapped students with special
educational needs if the recipient does not
offer programs designed to meet those needs.
Thus, a private school that has no program
for mentally retarded persons is neither required to admit such a person into its pro-

gram nor to arrange or pay for the provision
of the person’s education in another program. A private recipient without a special
program for blind students, however, would
not be permitted to exclude, on the basis of
blindness, a blind applicant who is able to
participate in the regular program with
minor adjustments in the manner in which
the program is normally offered.
SUBPART E—POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION
Subpart E prescribes requirements for nondiscrimination in recruitment, admission,
and treatment of students in postsecondary
education programs and activities, including
vocational education.
29. Admission and recruitment. In addition to
a general prohibition of discrimination on
the basis of handicap in § 104.42(a), the regulation delineates, in § 104.42(b), specific prohibitions concerning the establishment of limitations on admission of handicapped students, the use of tests or selection criteria,
and preadmission inquiry. Several changes
have been made in this provision.
Section 104.42(b) provides that postsecondary educational institutions may not use
any test or criterion for admission that has
a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons unless it has been validated
as a predictor of academic success and alternate tests or criteria with a less disproportionate, adverse effect are shown by the Department to be available. There are two significant changes in this approach from the
July 16 proposed regulation.
First, many commenters expressed concern
that § 104.42(b)(2)(ii) could be interpreted to
require a ‘‘global search’’ for alternate tests
that do not have a disproportionate, adverse
impact on handicapped persons. This was not
the intent of the provision and, therefore, it
has been amended to place the burden on the
Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, rather
than on the recipient, to identify alternate
tests.
Second, a new paragraph (d), concerning
validity studies, has been added. Under the
proposed regulation, overall success in an
education program, not just first-year
grades, was the criterion against which admissions tests were to be validated. This approach has been changed to reflect the comment of professional testing services that
use of first year grades would be less disruptive of present practice and that periodic validity studies against overall success in the
education program would be sufficient check
on the reliability of first-year grades.
Section 104.42(b)(3) also requires a recipient to assure itself that admissions tests are
selected and administered to applicants with
impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills
in such manner as is necessary to avoid unfair distortion of test results. Methods have
been developed for testing the aptitude and
achievement of persons who are not able to

Pt. 104, App. A

take written tests or even to make the
marks required for mechanically scored objective tests; in addition, methods for testing
persons with visual or hearing impairments
are available. A recipient, under this paragraph, must assure itself that such methods
are used with respect to the selection and administration of any admissions tests that it
uses.
Section 104.42(b)(3)(iii) has been amended
to require that admissions tests be administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible. In this context, ‘‘on the whole’’
means that not all of the facilities need be
accessibile so long as a sufficient number of
facilities are available to handicapped persons.
Revised § 104.42(b)(4) generally prohibits
preadmission inquiries as to whether an applicant has a handicap. The considerations
that led to this revision are similar to those
underlying the comparable revision of § 104.14
on preemployment inquiries. The regulation
does, however, allow inquiries to be made,
after admission but before enrollment, as to
handicaps that may require accommodation.
New paragraph (c) parallels the section on
preemployment inquiries and allows postsecondary institutions to inquire about applicants’ handicaps before admission, subject to
certain safeguards, if the purpose of the inquiry is to take remedial action to correct
past discrimination or to take voluntary action to overcome the limited participation of
handicapped persons in postsecondary educational institutions.
Proposed § 104.42(c), which would have allowed different admissions criteria in certain
cases for handicapped persons, was widely
misinterpreted in comments from both
handicapped persons and recipients. We have
concluded that the section is unnecessary,
and it has been deleted.
30. Treatment of students. Section 104.43 contains general provisions prohibiting the discriminatory treatment of qualified handicapped applicants. Paragraph (b) requires recipients to ensure that equal opportunities
are provided to its handicapped students in
education programs and activities that are
not operated by the recipient. The recipient
must be satisfied that the outside education
program or activity as a whole is nondiscriminatory. For example, a college must
ensure that discrimination on the basis of
handicap does not occur in connection with
teaching assignments of student teachers in
elementary or secondary schools not operated by the college. Under the ‘‘as a whole’’
wording, the college could continue to use elementary or secondary school systems that
discriminate if, and only if, the college’s student teaching program, when viewed in its
entirety, offered handicapped student teachers the same range and quality of choice in
student teaching assignments afforded nonhandicapped students.

Paragraph (c) of this section prohibits a recipient from excluding qualified handicapped
students from any course, course of study, or
other part of its education program or activity. This paragraph is designed to eliminate
the practice of excluding handicapped persons from specific courses and from areas of
concentration because of factors such as ambulatory difficulties of the student or assumptions by the recipient that no job would
be available in the area in question for a person with that handicap.
New paragraph (d) requires postsecondary
institutions to operate their programs and
activities so that handicapped students are
provided services in the most integrated setting appropriate. Thus, if a college had several elementary physics classes and had
moved one such class to the first floor of the
science building to accommodate students in
wheelchairs, it would be a violation of this
paragraph for the college to concentrate
handicapped students with no mobility impairments in the same class.
31. Academic adjustments. Paragraph (a) of
§ 104.44 requires that a recipient make certain adjustments to academic requirements
and practices that discriminate or have the
effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap. This requirement, like its predecessor
in the proposed regulation, does not obligate
an institution to waive course or other academic requirements. But such institutions
must accommodate those requirements to
the needs of individual handicapped students. For example, an institution might
permit an otherwise qualified handicapped
student who is deaf to substitute an art appreciation or music history course for a required course in music appreciation or could
modify the manner in which the music appreciation course is conducted for the deaf
student. It shoud be stressed that academic
requirements that can be demonstrated by
the recipient to be essential to its program
of instruction or to particular degrees need
not be changed.
Paragraph (b) provides that postsecondary
institutions may not impose rules that have
the effect of limiting the participation of
handicapped students in the education program. Such rules include prohibition of tape
recorders or braillers in classrooms and dog
guides in campus buildings. Several recipients expressed concern about allowing students to tape record lectures because the
professor may later want to copyright the
lectures. This problem may be solved by requiring students to sign agreements that
they will not release the tape recording or
transcription or otherwise hinder the professor’s ability to obtain a copyright.
Paragraph (c) of this section, concerning
the administration of course examinations
to students with impaired sensory, manual,
or speaking skills, parallels the regulation’s

provisions on admissions testing (§ 104.42(b))
and will be similarly interpreted.
Under § 104.44(d), a recipient must ensure
that no handicapped student is subject to
discrimination in the recipient’s program because of the absence of necessary auxiliary
educational aids. Colleges and universities
expressed concern about the costs of compliance with this provision.
The Department emphasizes that recipients can usually meet this obligation by assisting students in using existing resources
for auxiliary aids such as state vocational
rehabilitation agencies and private charitable organizations. Indeed, the Department
anticipates that the bulk of auxiliary aids
will be paid for by state and private agencies, not by colleges or universities. In those
circumstances where the recipient institution must provide the educational auxiliary
aid, the institution has flexibility in choosing the methods by which the aids will be
supplied. For example, some universities
have used students to work with the institution’s handicapped students. Other institutions have used existing private agencies
that tape texts for handicapped students free
of charge in order to reduce the number of
readers needed for visually impaired students.
As long as no handicapped person is excluded from a program because of the lack of
an appropriate aid, the recipient need not
have all such aids on hand at all times. Thus,
readers need not be available in the recipient’s library at all times so long as the
schedule of times when a reader is available
is established, is adhered to, and is sufficient. Of course, recipients are not required
to maintain a complete braille library.
32. Housing. Section 104.45(a) requires postsecondary institutions to provide housing to
handicapped students at the same cost as
they provide it to other students and in a
convenient, accessible, and comparable manner. Commenters, particularly blind persons
pointed out that some handicapped persons
can live in any college housing and need not
wait to the end of the transition period in
subpart C to be offered the same variety and
scope of housing accommodations given to
nonhandicapped persons. The Department
concurs with this position and will interpret
this section accordingly.
A number of colleges and universities reacted negatively to paragraph (b) of this section. It provides that, if a recipient assists in
making off-campus housing available to its
students, it should develop and implement
procedures to assure itself that off-campus
housing, as a whole, is available to handicapped students. Since postsecondary institutions are presently required to assure
themselves that off-campus housing is provided in a manner that does not discriminate
on the basis of sex (§ 106.32 of the title IX regulation), they may use the procedures devel-

oped under title IX in order to comply with
§ 104.45(b). It should be emphasized that not
every off-campus living accommodation need
be made accessible to handicapped persons.
33. Health and insurance. A proposed section, providing that recipients may not discriminate on the basis of handicap in the
provision of health related services, has been
deleted as duplicative of the general provisions of § 104.43. This deletion represents no
change in the obligation of recipients to provide nondiscriminatory health and insurance
plans. The Department will continue to require that nondiscriminatory health services
be provided to handicapped students. Recipients are not required, however, to provide
specialized services and aids to handicapped
persons in health programs. If, for example,
a college infirmary treats only simple disorders such as cuts, bruises, and colds, its obligation to handicapped persons is to treat
such disorders for them.
34. Financial assistance. Section 104.46(a),
prohibiting discrimination in providing financial assistance, remains substantively
the same. It provides that recipients may
not provide less assistance to or limit the
eligibility of qualified handicapped persons
for such assistance, whether the assistance is
provided directly by the recipient or by another entity through the recipient’s sponsorship. Awards that are made under wills,
trusts, or similar legal instruments in a discriminatory manner are permissible, but
only if the overall effect of the recipient’s
provision of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of handicap.
It will not be considered discriminatory to
deny, on the basis of handicap, an athletic
scholarship to a handicapped person if the
handicap renders the person unable to qualify for the award. For example, a student
who has a neurological disorder might be denied a varsity football scholarship on the
basis of his inability to play football, but a
deaf person could not, on the basis of handicap, be denied a scholarship for the school’s
diving team. The deaf person could, however,
be denied a scholarship on the basis of comparative diving ability.
Commenters on § 104.46(b), which applies to
assistance in obtaining outside employment
for students, expressed similar concerns to
those raised under § 104.43(b), concerning cooperative programs. This paragraph has been
changed in the same manner as § 104.43(b) to
include the ‘‘as a whole’’ concept and will be
interpreted in the same manner as § 104.43(b).
35. Nonacademic services. Section 104.47 establishes nondiscrimination standards for
physical education and athletics counseling
and placement services, and social organizations. This section sets the same standards
as does § 104.38 of subpart D, discussed above,
and will be interpreted in a similar fashion.

Pt. 104, App. A

SUBPART F—HEALTH, WELFARE, AND SOCIAL
SERVICES
Subpart F applies to recipients that operate health, welfare, and social service programs. The Department received fewer comments on this subpart than on others.
Although many commented that subpart F
lacked specificity, these commenters provided neither concrete suggestions nor additions. Nevertheless, some changes have been
made, pursuant to comment, to clarify the
obligations of recipients in specific areas. In
addition, in an effort to reduce duplication
in the regulation, the section governing recipients providing health services has been
consolidated with the section regulating providers of welfare and social services. Since
the separate provisions that appeared in the
proposed regulation were almost identical,
no substantive change should be inferred
from their consolidation.
Several commenters asked whether subpart F applies to vocational rehabilitation
agencies whose purpose is to assist in the rehabilitation of handicapped persons. To the
extent that such agencies receive financial
assistance from the Department, they are
covered by subpart F and all other relevant
subparts of the regulation. Nothing in this
regulation, however, precludes such agencies
from servicing only handicapped persons. Indeed, § 104.4(c) permits recipients to offer
services or benefits that are limited by federal law to handicapped persons or classes of
handicapped persons.
Many comments suggested requiring state
social service agencies to take an active role
in the enforcement of section 504 with regard
to local social service providers. The Department believes that the possibility for federal-state cooperation in the administration
and enforcement of section 504 warrants further consideration.
A number of comments also discussed
whether section 504 should be read to require
payment of compensation to institutionalized handicapped patients who perform services for the institution in which they reside.
The Department of Labor has recently issued
a proposed regulation under the Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA) that covers the question of compensation for institutionalized
persons. 42 FR 15224 (March 18, 1977). This Department will seek information and comment from the Department of Labor concerning that agency’s experience administering the FLSA regulation.
36. Health, welfare, and other social service
providers. Section 104.52(a) has been expanded
in several respects. The addition of new paragraph (a)(2) is intended to make clear the
basic requirement of equal opportunity to receive benefits or services in the health, welfare, and social service areas. The paragraph
parallels §§ 104.4(b)(ii) and 104.43(b). New
paragaph (a)(3) requires the provision of ef-

fective benefits or services, as defined in
§ 104.4(b)(2) (i.e., benefits or services which
‘‘afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to obtain the same result (or) to gain
the same benefit * * *’’).
Section 104.52(a) also includes provisions
concerning the limitation of benefits or services to handicapped persons and the subjection of handicapped persons to different eligibility standards. One common misconception about the regulation is that it would require specialized hospitals and other health
care providers to treat all handicapped persons. The regulation makes no such requirement. Thus, a burn treatment center need
not provide other types of medical treatment
to handicapped persons unless it provides
such medical services to nonhandicapped
persons. It could not, however, refuse to
treat the burns of a deaf person because of
his or her deafness.
Commenters had raised the question of
whether the prohibition against different
standards of eligibility might preclude recipients from providing special services to
handicapped persons or classes of handicapped persons. The regulation will not be so
interpreted, and the specific section in question has been eliminated. Section 104.4(c)
makes clear that special programs for handicapped persons are permitted.
A new paragraph (a)(5) concerning the provision of different or separate services or
benefits has been added. This provision prohibits such treatment unless necessary to
provide qualified handicapped persons with
benefits and services that are as effective as
those provided to others.
Section 104.52(b) has been amended to
cover written material concerning waivers of
rights or consent to treatment as well as
general notices concerning health benefits or
services. The section requires the recipient
to ensure that qualified handicapped persons
are not denied effective notice because of
their handicap. For example, recipients
could use several different types of notice in
order to reach persons with impaired vision
or hearing, such as brailled messages, radio
spots, and tacticle devices on cards or envelopes to inform blind persons of the need to
call the recipient for further information.
Section 104.52(c) is a new section requiring
recipient hospitals to establish a procedure
for effective communication with persons
with impaired hearing for the purpose of providing emergency health care. Although it
would be appropriate for a hospital to fulfill
its responsibilities under this section by having a full-time interpreter for the deaf on
staff, there may be other means of accomplishing the desired result of assuring that
some means of communication is immediately available for deaf persons needing
emergency treatment.

Section 104.52(c), also a new provision, requires recipients with fifteen or more employees to provide appropriate auxiliary aids
for persons with impaired sensory, manual,
or speaking skills. Further, the Assistant
Secretary may require a small provider to
furnish auxiliary aids where the provision of
aids would not adversely affect the ability of
the recipient to provide its health benefits or
service.
37. Treatment of Drug Addicts and Alcoholics.
Section 104.53 is a new section that prohibits
discrimination in the treatment and admission of drug and alcohol addicts to hospitals
and outpatient facilities. Section 104.53 prohibits discrimination against drug abusers
by operators of outpatient facilities, despite
the fact that section 407 pertains only to hospitals, because of the broader application of
section 504. This provision does not mean
that all hospitals and outpatient facilities
must treat drug addiction and alcoholism. It
simply means, for example, that a cancer
clinic may not refuse to treat cancer patients simply because they are also alcoholics.
38. Education of institutionalized persons.
The regulation retains § 104.54 of the proposed regulation that requires that an appropriate education be provided to qualified
handicapped persons who are confined to residential institutions or day care centers.
SUBPART G—PROCEDURES
In § 104.61, the Secretary has adopted the
title VI complaint and enforcement procedures for use in implementing section 504
until such time as they are superseded by
the issuance of a consolidated procedureal

rights statutes and executive orders administered by the Department.

§ 105.3

§ 105.3 Definitions.
For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply:
Auxiliary aids means services or devices that enable persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking
skills to have an equal opportunity to
participate in, and enjoy the benefits
of, programs or activities conducted by
the Department. For example, auxiliary aids useful for persons with impaired vision include readers, materials
in braille, audio recordings, and other
similar services and devices. Auxiliary
aids useful for persons with impaired
hearing include telephone handset amplifiers, telephones compatible with
hearing aids, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDDs), interpreters, notetakers, written materials,
and other similar services and devices.
Complete complaint means a written
statement that contains the complainant’s name and address and describes
the Department’s alleged discriminatory action in sufficient detail to inform the Department of the nature and
date of the alleged violation of section
504. It must be signed by the complainant or by someone authorized to do so
on his or her behalf. Complaints filed
on behalf of classes or third parties
must describe or identify (by name, if
possible) the alleged victims of discrimination.
Facility means all or any portion of
buildings,
structures,
equipment,
roads, walks, parking lots, rolling
stock or other conveyances, or other
real or personal property.
Historic preservation programs means
programs conducted by the Department that have preservation of historic

34 CFR Ch. I (7–1–03 Edition)

§ 105.31 Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.
Except as otherwise provided in
§ 105.32, no qualified individual with
handicaps shall, because the Department’s facilities are inaccessible to or
unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity conducted by the Department.
§ 105.32 Program accessibility: Existing facilities.
(a) General. The Department shall operate each program or activity so that
the program or activity, viewed in its
entirety, is readily accessible to and
usable by individuals with handicaps.
This paragraph does not—
(1) Necessarily require the Department to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;
(2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the Department
to take any action that would result in
a substantial impairment of significant
historic features of an historic property; or
(3)(i) Require the Department to take
any action that it can demonstrate
would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.
(ii) The Department has the burden
of proving that compliance with
§ 105.32(a) would result in that alteration or those burdens.
(iii) The decision that compliance
would result in that alteration or those
burdens must be made by the Secretary
after considering all of the Department’s resources available for use in
the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must
be accompanied by a written statement
of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.
(iv) If an action would result in that
alteration or those burdens, the Department shall take any other action
that would not result in the alteration
or burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps
receive the benefits and services of the
program or activity.

(b) Methods—(1) General. (i) The Department may comply with the requirements of this section through
such means as redesign of equipment,
reassignment of services to accessible
buildings, assignments of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs
or activities readily accessible to and
usable by individuals with handicaps.
(ii) The Department is not required
to make structural changes in existing
facilities if other methods are effective
in achieving compliance with this section.
(iii) The Department, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall
meet accessibility requirements to the
extent compelled by the Architectural
Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42
U.S.C. 4151–4157), and any regulations
implementing that Act.
(iv) In choosing among available
methods for meeting the requirements
of this section, the Department shall
give priority to those methods that
offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the
most integrated setting appropriate.
(2) Historic preservation programs. In
meeting the requirements of § 105.32(a)
in historic preservation programs, the
Department shall give priority to
methods that provide physical access
to individuals with handicaps. In cases
were a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because
of § 105.32 (a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative
methods of achieving program accessibility include—
(i) Using audiovisual materials and
devices to depict those portions of an
historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;
(ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through
portions of historic properties that
cannot otherwise be made accessible;
or
(iii) Adopting other innovative methods.
(c) Time period for compliance. The Department shall comply with the obligations established under this section
within 60 days of the effective date of

(2) The Department shall provide an
opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or
organizations representing individuals
with handicaps, to participate in the
development of the transition plan by
submitting comments (both oral and
written). A copy of the transition plan
must be made available for public inspection.
(3) The plan must, at a minimum—

Department’s facilities that limit the
accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;
(ii) Describe in detail the methods
that will be used to make the facilities
accessible;
(iii) Specify the schedule for taking
the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time
period of the transition plan is longer

the instrument or its application.
(c) Disproportion in classes. Where a

students differently on the basis of sex.
(b) Pregnancy and related conditions.
(1) A recipient shall not discriminate
against any student, or exclude any
student from its education program or
activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such

pregnancy, termination of pregnancy
or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.
(2) A recipient may require such a
student to obtain the certification of a
physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue
participation so long as such a certification is required of all students for
other physical or emotional conditions
requiring the attention of a physician.
(3) A recipient which operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students,
admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as
provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to

(4) A recipient shall treat pregnancy,
childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery
therefrom in the same manner and
under the same policies as any other

admitted to the recipient’s educational
program or activity.
(5) In the case of a recipient which
does not maintain a leave policy for its
students, or in the case of a student
who does not otherwise qualify for
leave under such a policy, a recipient
shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false
pregnancy, termination of pregnancy
and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for so long
a period of time as is deemed medically
necessary by the student’s physician,
at the conclusion of which the student

shall be reinstated to the status which
she held when the leave began.

§ 106.41

Athletics.

(a) General. No person shall, on the
basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be
treated differently from another person
or otherwise be discriminated against
in any interscholastic, intercollegiate,
club or intramural athletics offered by
a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on
such basis.
(b) Separate teams. Notwithstanding
the requirements of paragraph (a) of
this section, a recipient may operate or
sponsor separate teams for members of
each sex where selection for such
teams is based upon competitive skill
or the activity involved is a contact
sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular
sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex
have previously been limited, members
of the excluded sex must be allowed to
try-out for the team offered unless the
sport involved is a contact sport. For
the purposes of this part, contact
sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby,
ice hockey, football, basketball and
other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.
(c) Equal opportunity. A recipient
which operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics shall provide equal
athletic opportunity for members of
both sexes. In determining whether
equal opportunities are available the
Director will consider, among other
factors:
(1) Whether the selection of sports
and levels of competition effectively
accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;
(2) The provision of equipment and
supplies;

of opportunity for members of each
sex.

(2) Administer, operate, offer, or participate in a fringe benefit plan which
does not provide either for equal periodic benefits for members of each sex,
or for equal contributions to the plan
by such recipient for members of each
sex; or
(3) Administer, operate, offer, or participate in a pension or retirement plan
which establishes different optional or
compulsory retirement ages based on
sex or which otherwise discriminates in

apply any policy or take any employment action:
(1) Concerning the potential marital,
parental, or family status of an employee or applicant for employment
which treats persons differently on the
basis of sex; or
(2) Which is based upon whether an
employee or applicant for employment
is the head of household or principal
wage earner in such employee’s or applicant’s family unit.
(b) Pregnancy. A recipient shall not

(d) Pregnancy leave. In the case of a
recipient which does not maintain a
leave policy for its employees, or in the
case of an employee with insufficient
leave or accrued employment time to
qualify for leave under such a policy, a
recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of
pregnancy and recovery therefrom as a
justification for a leave of absence
without pay for a reasonable period of
time, at the conclusion of which the
employee shall be reinstated to the status which she held when the leave
began or to a comparable position,
without decrease in rate of compensation or loss of promotional opportunities, or any other right or privilege of
employment.
(Authority: Secs. 901, 902, Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 374; 20 U.S.C. 1681,

§ 106.58 Effect of State or local law or
other requirements.
(a) Prohibitory requirements. The obligation to comply with this subpart is
not obviated or alleviated by the existence of any State or local law or other

members of one sex which are not imposed upon members of the other sex.
(b) Benefits. A recipient which provides any compensation, service, or
benefit to members of one sex pursuant
to a State or local law or other requirement shall provide the same compensation, service, or benefit to members of
the other sex.

to use age distinctions and factors
other than age that meet the requirements of the Act.

do these regulations apply?
(a) These regulations apply to any
program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance from ED.
(b) These regulations do not apply
to—

(ii) Establishes criteria for participation in age-related terms; or
(iii) Describes intended beneficiaries
or target groups in age-related terms;
or
(2) Any employment practice of any
employer, employment agency, labor

for employment under the Job Training Partnership Act (29 U.S.C. 1501 et
seq.).

(a) Normal operation means the operation of a program or activity without
significant changes that would impair
its ability to meet its objectives.
(b) Statutory objective means any purpose of a program or activity expressly
stated in any Federal statute, State
statute, or local statute or ordinance
adopted by an elected, general purpose
legislative body.
(Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6103)

§ 110.12 Exceptions
to
the
rules
against age discrimination: Normal
operation or statutory objective of
any program or activity.
A recipient is permitted to take an
action otherwise prohibited by § 110.10
if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the
normal operation or the achievement
of any statutory objective of a program
or activity. An action reasonably takes
into account age as a factor necessary
to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a
program or activity, if—
(a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics;
(b) The other characteristic or characteristics must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to
continue, or to achieve any statutory
objective of the program or activity;
(c) The other characteristic or characteristics can be reasonably measured
or approximated by the use of age; and
(d) The other characteristic or characteristics are impractical to measure
directly on an individual basis.

to
the
rules
against age discrimination: Reasonable factors other than age.
A recipient is permitted to take an
action otherwise prohibited by § 110.10
that is based on a factor other than
age, even though that action may have
a disproportionate effect on persons of
different ages. An action may be based
on a factor other than age only if the
factor bears a direct and substantial
relationship to the normal operation of
the program or activity or to the
achievement of a statutory objective.
(Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6103)

§ 110.14

Burden of proof.

The burden of proving that an age
distinction or other action falls within
the exceptions outlined in §§ 110.12 and
110.13 is on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.
(Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6104)

§ 110.15 Affirmative action by recipients.
Even in the absence of a finding of
discrimination, a recipient may take
affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in the recipient’s
program or activity on the basis of age.
(Authority: 42 U.S.C. 6103)

§ 110.16 Special benefits for children
and the elderly.
If a recipient operating a program or

assistance is provided in the form of
real property or interest in the property from ED, the instrument effecting

a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period
during which the real property is used
for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for
another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.
(2) If no transfer of property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any
subsequent transfer of the property.

provided in the form of real property or
interest in the property from ED, the
covenant must also include a condition
coupled with a right to be reserved by

may conduct these reviews in the absence of a complaint against a recipient. The review may be as comprehensive as necessary to determine whether
a violation of these regulations occurred.
(b) If a compliance review or preaward review indicates a violation of
the Act or these regulations, ED attempts to achieve voluntary compliance with the Act. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, ED arranges
for enforcement as described in § 110.35.

the alleged discrimination. However,
for good cause shown, ED may extend
this time limit.
(b) ED attempts to facilitate the filing of complaints, if possible, by—

Mediation and Conciliation Service or
to the mediation agency designated by
the Secretary of Health and Human
Services, all complaints that—

the party and the mediator is impractical.
(c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator
shall prepare a written statement of
the agreement and have the complainant and recipient sign it. The mediator

shall send a copy of the agreement to
ED. ED takes no further action on the
complaint unless informed that the
complainant or the recipient fails to
comply with the agreement, at which
time ED reinstates the complaint.
(d) The mediator shall protect the
confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation
process. No mediator shall testify in
any adjudicative proceeding, produce
any document, or otherwise disclose

§ 110.33

Investigation.

(a) Initial investigation. ED investigates complaints that are unresolved
after mediation or reopened because of
a violation of the mediation agreement. ED uses methods during the investigation to encourage voluntary resolution of the complaint, including discussions with the complainant and recipient to establish the facts and, if
possible, resolve the complaint to the
mutual satisfaction of the parties. ED
may seek the assistance of any involved State, local, or other Federal
agency.
(b) Formal investigation, conciliation,
and hearing. If ED cannot resolve the
complaint during the early stages of
the investigation, ED completes the investigation of the complaint and
makes formal findings. If the investigation indicates a violation of the
Act or these regulations, ED attempts
to achieve voluntary compliance. If ED
cannot obtain voluntary compliance,

(i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any
rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the

(1) ED has advised the recipient of its
failure to comply with the Act or with

(d) The Secretary also may defer
granting new Federal financial assistance from ED to a recipient if termination proceedings in § 110.35(a)(1) are
initiated.
(1) New Federal financial assistance
from ED includes all assistance for

hearing has begun within that time or
the time for beginning the hearing has
been extended by mutual consent of
the recipient and ED. A deferral may
not continue for more than 30 days
after the close of the hearing, unless
the hearing results in a finding against
the recipient.
