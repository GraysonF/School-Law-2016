(p) 
This subsection applies to all surface waters of the state. The department shall complete an antidegradation review of all NPDES general permits. The department may modify the general permits for purposes of antidegradation compliance. After an antidegradation review of a permit is conducted under this subsection, activities 


covered by an NPDES general permit are not required to undergo an additional antidegradation review. An NPDES general permit may not be used to authorize a discharge into an outstanding national resource water or an outstanding state resource water, except that a short term, temporary storm water discharge to an outstanding national resource water or to an outstanding state resource water may be permitted under an NPDES general permit if the commissioner determines that the discharge will not significantly lower the water quality downstream of the discharge.

(16) 
Inclusion by the applicant of additional factors that may enhance the social or economic importance associated with the proposed discharge, such as an approval that: 

(A) 
recognizes social or economic importance; and 

(B)

state; 

(B) 
county; 

(C) 
township; or 



(D) 
municipality; 
potentially affected by the proposed discharge. 


(18) 
Any other action or recommendation relevant to the antidegradation demonstration received during the public participation process. 

(19)

IC 13-18-3-2.3 Designated use change to CSO wet weather category; long term control plans 
Sec. 2.3. (a) This subsection applies if a use attainability analysis is performed and approved to change the designated use of a water body receiving wet weather discharges from combined sewer overflows from the recreational use designation that applied to the waters immediately before the application to the waters of the CSO wet weather subcategory established in section 2.5 of this chapter to that subcategory. Upon implementation of the approved long term control plan, the plan fulfills the water quality goals of the state with respect to wet weather discharges that are a result of overflows from the combined sewer system addressed by the plan.

The following requirements apply to the CSO wet weather limited use subcategory: 
(1) 
The water quality based requirements associated with the CSO wet weather limited use subcategory that apply to waters affected by wet weather combined sewer overflows are determined by an approved long term control plan for the combined sewer system. The water quality based requirements remain in effect during the time and to the physical extent that the recreational use designation that applied to the waters immediately before the application to the waters of the CSO wet weather limited use subcategory is not attained, but for not more than four (4) days after the date the overflow discharge ends. 

(2) 
At all times other than those described in subdivision (1), the water quality criteria associated with the appropriate recreational use designation that applied to the waters immediately before the application to the waters of the CSO wet weather limited use subcategory apply unless there is a change in the use designation as a result of a use attainability analysis. 


(b) The CSO wet weather limited use subcategory applies if: 
(1) 
the department has approved a long term control plan for the NPDES permit holder for the combined sewer system; 

(2)

(d) 
The department shall implement the CSO wet weather limited use subcategory and associated water quality based requirements under this section when the subcategory and requirements are approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The department shall seek approval of the United States Environmental Protection Agency in a timely manner. 

(e) 
The NPDES permit holder shall monitor its discharges and the water quality in the affected receiving stream periodically as provided in the long term control plan. The NPDES permit holder shall provide all such information to the department. 


(f) In conjunction with a review of its long term control plan under section 2.4 of this chapter, the NPDES permit holder shall review information generated after the use attainability analysis was approved by the department to determine whether the conclusion of the use attainability analysis is still valid. The NPDES permit holder shall provide the results of the review to the department. 
(g) The board shall adopt rules under IC 13-14-8 and IC 13-14-9 to implement this section before October 1, 2006. As added by P.L.140-2000, SEC.20. Amended by P.L.54-2005, SEC.4.

After 327 IAC 5 and 327 IAC 15 are amended under subsection (a), the terms and conditions of an NPDES general permit under that article as they existed before the amendment remain in effect and are binding on any person regulated under the NPDES general permit until the person submits a notice of intent to be covered by an NPDES general permit developed and issued under subsection (b).

Any person regulated under an NPDES general permit on the effective date of the amendment required by subsection (a) must: 

(1) 
submit a notice of intent described in subsection (c) not later than ninety (90) days after the department makes the form of the notice of intent available to the person; or 

(2) 
apply for an NPDES individual permit under 327 IAC 5 to maintain permit coverage required under the Clean Water Act.
