annually thereafter. 

(c) 
The written notice described in subsection (b) must:

(3) 
include a statement that: 

(A) 
The public agency must provide written notice and obtain written parental consent prior to accessing the student's or the parent's public benefits or public insurance for the first time. 

(B) 
The parental consent form provided to the parent must specify the: 

(i) 
personally identifiable information that the public agency may disclose;

(ii) 
require parents to incur an out-of-pocket expense such as the payment of a deductible or copay amount incurred in filing a claim for services provided pursuant to this part; and 


(iii) use a student's benefits under a public benefits or insurance program if that use would: (AA) decrease available lifetime coverage or any other insured benefit; (BB) result in the family paying for services that would otherwise be covered by the public benefits or insurance program and that are required for the student outside of the time the student is in school; 
(CC) increase the premiums or lead to the discontinuation of benefits or insurance; or (DD) risk loss of eligibility for home and community-based waivers, based on aggregate health-related expenditures. 

(D)

(E) 
The parent's refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent to disclose personally identifiable information to the agency responsible for the administration of the state's public benefits or public insurance program does not relieve the public agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required services are provided at no cost to the parent. 



(d) 
The written consent form shall: 

(1) 
describe the personally identifiable information that the public agency may disclose;

(1) 
Obtain informed parental consent as defined by 511 IAC 7-32-17. 

(2) 
Inform the parent that refusal to permit the public agency to access the private insurance does not relieve the public agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required services are provided at no cost to the parent. 


(g) 
If a public agency is unable to obtain informed parental consent to access the parent's private insurance, or public benefits or insurance when the parent would incur a cost for a specified service required under this article, the public agency may use its Part B federal funds to pay for the service in order to ensure a free appropriate public education is provided to the student. These funds may also be used to avoid financial cost to a parent who otherwise would consent to the use of private insurance or public benefits or insurance. If the parent would incur a cost, such as a deductible or copay amounts, the public agency may use its Part B funds to pay the cost. 

(h) 
Proceeds from public benefits or insurance or private insurance shall not be considered program income for purposes of 34 CFR 80.25 with respect to the administration of federal grants and cooperative agreements.

511 IAC 7-34-7 Requirements pertaining to Part B funds 
Authority: IC 20-19-2-8; IC 20-19-2-16 
Affected: IC 20-19-2; IC 20-35 
Sec. 7. (a) A public agency must do the following: 
(1) 
Offer services to each student who is: 

(A) 
eligible to receive special education and related services; and 

(B) 
parentally-placed by his or her parent in a nonpublic school within the boundaries of the public agency. Public agencies may use state funds and Part B funds to provide services under this rule. 



(2) 
Control and administer Part B funds that are used to provide special education and related services under this rule. 

(3) 
Determine the number of parentally-placed nonpublic school students with disabilities attending nonpublic schools located in the public agency. The count: 

(A) 
must be conducted annually on December 1; and 

(B) 
is used to determine the amount of Part B funds that the public agency must spend on providing special education and related services to parentally-placed nonpublic school students with disabilities in the next subsequent school year. 



(4) 
Spend a proportionate share of its Part B funds to serve parentally-placed nonpublic school students with disabilities. The proportionate amount of Part B funds must be calculated according the specifications set forth in subsections (b) through (e). 


(b) 
The public agency, in providing special education and related services to students in nonpublic schools and facilities, must expend at least an amount that is the same proportion of the public agency total subgrant under 20 U.S.C. 1411(f) as the number of nonpublic school students with disabilities, who are enrolled by their parents in nonpublic schools or facilities within its boundaries, is to the total number of students with disabilities of the same age range. 

(c) 
To calculate the proportionate amount of Part B funds specified in subsection (b), the public agency must take the following steps: 

(1) 
Using data from the previous calendar year's December 1 count, divide the number of parentally-placed nonpublic school students with disabilities by the total number of students with disabilities (public school and nonpublic school students). 

(2) 
The quotient obtained in subdivision (1) is multiplied by the public agency's current total subgrant under 20 U.S.C. 1411(f). 

(3) 
The product obtained in subdivision (2) equals the public agency's proportionate amount of Part B funds that must be spent on parentally-placed nonpublic school students. 



(d) 
For students three (3) years of age through five (5) years of age, the public agency, in providing special education and related services to students in nonpublic schools and facilities, must expend at least an amount that is the same proportion of the public agency total subgrant under 20 U.S.C. 1419(g) as the number of nonpublic school students with disabilities three (3) years of age through five (5) years of age who are enrolled by their parents in nonpublic schools or facilities that meet the definition of elementary school in 511 IAC 7-32-33 within its boundaries, is to the total number of students with disabilities three (3) years of age through five (5) years of age. 

(e) 
To calculate the proportionate amount of Part B funds specified in subsection (d), the public agency must take the following steps: 

(1) 
Using data from the previous calendar year's December 1 count, divide the number of parentally-placed students with disabilities three (3) years of age through five (5) years of age, who attend nonpublic schools that meet the definition of an elementary school in 511 IAC 7-32-33, by the total number of students with disabilities three (3) years of age through five 

(5) 
years of age (public school and nonpublic school students). 

(2) 
The quotient obtained in subdivision (1) is multiplied by the public agency's current total subgrant under 20 U.S.C. 1419(g). 

(3) 
The product obtained in subdivision (2) equals the public agency's proportionate amount of Part B funds that must be spent on parentally-placed nonpublic school students three (3) years of age through five (5) years of age who attend nonpublic schools that meet the definition of elementary school in 511 IAC 7-32-33. 



(f) 
A public agency must calculate the proportionate share of Part B funds before designating funds for early intervening services. 


(g) State and local funds may supplement but in no case supplant the proportionate share of Part B funds required to be expended for parentally-placed nonpublic school students with disabilities under this rule. 
(h) If a public agency has not expended all of the proportionate amount of Part B funds described in subsections (b) through 
(e) 
by the end of the fiscal year for which the division of special education allocated the funds, the public agency must obligate the remaining funds for special education and related services, including direct services, to parentally-placed nonpublic school students with disabilities during a carryover period of one (1) additional year. 

(i) 
Expenditures for child find activities, including the cost of individual evaluations and reevaluations, shall not be considered in determining whether the public agency has met the proportionate share requirement in this section. 

(j) 
The public agency shall not use the Part B funds to do the following: 

(1) 
Fund existing levels of instruction currently provided by the nonpublic school or facility, or otherwise benefit the nonpublic school. 

(2) 
Meet the needs of the nonpublic school or facility. 

(3) 
Meet the general needs of the students enrolled in the nonpublic school or facility. 

(4) 
Fund classes that are organized separately on the basis of school enrollment or religion of the students if the classes: 

(A) 
are at the same site; and 

(B) 
include students enrolled in public schools and students enrolled in nonpublic schools. 



(k) 
The public agency may use Part B funds for the following: 

(1) 
To make public school personnel available in places other than public facilities: 

(A) 
to the extent necessary to provide special education and related services to students with disabilities in nonpublic schools or facilities; and 

(B) 
if those services are not normally provided by the nonpublic school or facility.

(2) 
The nonpublic placement is appropriate. 



(f) 
The hearing officer or the court may find that the nonpublic placement made by the parent is appropriate even if the placement does not meet the state standards that apply to education provided by public agencies. 

(g)

(1) 
If: 

(A)

(B) 
at least ten (10) business days (including any holidays that occur on a business day) prior to the removal of the student from the public agency, the parents did not give written notice to the public agency of the information described in clause (A).

(2) 
compliance with subsection (g)(1) would likely result in serious emotional harm to the student.

(c) 
Special education teachers who do not teach core academic subjects only have to meet the highly qualified special education teacher requirements in subsection (a). A special education teacher does not teach core academic subjects if the special 


education teacher: 
(1) 
is a co-teacher who: 

(A) 
works within the general education setting in which a highly qualified general education teacher provides instruction to the class on core academic elementary content or a core academic middle, junior high, or high school subject; and

is a resource room teacher who provides direct assistance to students with disabilities, such as tutoring and reinforcement of content provided in the general education setting, in segregated settings after the students receive instruction on core academic elementary content or a core academic middle, junior high, or high school subject from a highly qualified general education teacher; or 

(4) 
provides direct instruction to students with disabilities on noncore academic subjects, such as: 

(A) 
life skills; 

(B) 
study skills; and 

(C) 
community based instruction. 




(d) 
Special education teachers who teach core academic subjects, as defined in 511 IAC 7-32-21, must be highly qualified as a special education teacher under subsection (a) and highly qualified in the core academic subjects under 511 IAC 7-32-44. Special education teachers teach core academic subjects in the following situations: 

(1) 
The special education teacher is the primary teacher providing instruction to elementary students in the core academic elementary content. 

(2) 
The special education teacher is the primary teacher providing instruction to middle, junior high, or high school students in a core academic subject. 

(3) 
The special education teacher team teaches in the general education setting alongside a highly qualified teacher of elementary academic content or a core academic middle, junior high, or high school subject, and the teachers share responsibilities for the: 

(A) 
design and delivery of instruction; and 

(B) 
evaluation of student performance. 





(e) 
Special education teachers who teach core academic subjects exclusively to students who are assessed against alternate achievement standards must meet the requirements in subsection (a) and, whether they are a new or a veteran teacher, may either meet the: 

(1) 
applicable requirements of 511 IAC 7-32-44 for any new or veteran elementary, middle, junior, or high school teacher; or 

(2) 
requirements of 511 IAC 7-32-44(b)(2) or 511 IAC 7-32-44(b)(3) as applied to an elementary school teacher and, in the case of instruction above the elementary level, have subject matter knowledge appropriate to the level of instruction being provided, as determined by the state. 



(f) 
Special education teachers who teach two (2) or more core academic subjects exclusively to students with disabilities (including students assessed against alternative achievement standards) must meet the requirements in subsection (a) and may either: 

(1) 
meet the applicable requirements of 511 IAC 7-32-44(b)(2) or 511 IAC 7-32-44(b)(3); 

(2) 
in the case of a veteran teacher, demonstrate competence in all the core academic subjects in which the teacher teaches in the same manner as is required for a veteran elementary, middle, junior high, or high school teacher under 511 IAC 7-32­44, which may include a single, high objective uniform state standard of evaluation (HOUSSE) covering multiple subjects; or 

(3) 
in the case of a new special education teacher who: 

(A) teaches multiple subjects; and 

(B) 
is highly qualified in mathematics, language arts, or science; demonstrate, not later than two (2) years after the date of employment, competence in the other core academic subjects in which the teacher teaches in the same manner as is required for an elementary, middle, junior high, or high school teacher under 511 IAC 7-32-44, which may include a single HOUSSE covering multiple subjects. 



(g) 
Notwithstanding any other individual right of action that a parent or student may maintain under this article, nothing in this section shall be construed to: 

(1) 
create a right of action on behalf of an individual student or class of students for the failure of a public agency employee to be highly qualified; or 

(2) 
prevent a parent from filing a complaint under 511 IAC 7-45-1 about staff qualifications with the division of special education. 



(h) 
A teacher who is highly qualified under this section is considered highly qualified for purposes of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended by 20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq. 

(i) 
For purposes of subsection (f)(3), a fully licensed regular education teacher who subsequently becomes fully licensed as a special education teacher is a new special education teacher when first hired as a special education teacher. 

(j) 
The requirements in this section do not apply to teachers hired by nonpublic elementary, middle, junior high, or high schools, including nonpublic school teachers hired or contracted bypublic agencies to provide special education and related services to parentally-placed nonpublic school students with disabilities under 511 IAC 7-34-7(k)(2). 

(k) 
Because the early childhood special education program described in section 5 of this rule is not part of the state's public elementary, middle, junior high, and high school system, kindergarten through grade 12, early childhood teachers do not have to meet the highly qualified teacher requirements. However, early childhood special education teachers do have to be appropriately licensed.

Sec. 7. (a) Each student shall be involved in and progress in the general education curriculum, to the maximum extent feasible, as determined by the student's CCC. The public agency may supplement the general education curriculum with modified programs of instruction or curriculum that relate to state academic standards and functional skills to be achieved. 
(b) 
The public agency shall provide to students with disabilities instructional materials and supplies comparable to those provided to nondisabled students. 

(c) 
A student's CCC must determine whether the student needs instructional materials, including print instructional materials as defined in 511 IAC 7-32-75, in an accessible format. 

(d) 
For purposes of this section, "accessible format" means an alternate approach to presenting information to a student with a disability. Accessible formats may be purchased ready for use by students with disabilities, developed for use by students with disabilities, or modified from existing materials in accordance with federal and state copyright laws. Accessible formats include, but are not limited to, the following: 

(1) 
Braille. 

(2) 
Audio. 

(3) 
Digital text. 

(4)

(f) 
If a student's CCC determines that a student needs print instructional materials in an accessible format, the public agency must provide the materials to the student in a timely manner as described in subsection (h). 

(g) 
When a student needs print instructional materials in an accessible format, the public agency must determine whether thestudent isa student with aprintdisabilityasdefined in 511 IAC 7-32-93. Thismayrequirethepublicagencytoobtain a written certification statementfromacompetentauthorityaccordingtopoliciesandproceduresestablishedbythedepartmentofeducation. A competent authority is a recognized expert who attests to the physical basis of the visual, perceptual, or other physical disability that limits the student's use of standard print, in accordance with policies and procedures established by the department of education. 

(h) 
For purposes of this section, "timely manner" means that a public agency will take all reasonable steps to ensure that students who need print instructional materials in accessible formats are provided those materials at the same time as other students receive instructional materials. Reasonable steps include, but are not limited to, the following: 

(1) 
Requiring publishers or other contractors to, at a minimum, provide the National Instructional Materials Access Center (NIMAC) with electronic files containing the content of the print instructional materials using the National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS). Such files must be provided to the NIMAC with sufficient time, according to policies and procedures established by the department of education, to ensure that students requiring accessible formats receive the instructional materials at the same time as other students receive the instructional materials. 

(2) 
Having a means of acquiring print instructional materials in accessible formats according to policies and procedures established by the department of education, including for students who transfer into the public agency after the start of the school year. 




Reasonable steps would not include withholding print instructional materials from other students until print instructional materials in accessible formats are available. 
(i) 
Nothing in this section relieves a public agency of its responsibility to ensure that the following students, who need print instructional materials in accessible formats, receive those materials in a timely manner: 

(1) 
A student who is not a student with a print disability as defined in 511 IAC 7-32-93. 

(2) 
A student who needs print instructional materials that cannot be produced from NIMAS files. 



(j) 
Charges to the parent for textbook rental, incidental fees, or any other fees permitted by state statute or rule do not violate the at no cost requirement. 

(k) 
The public agency shall provide instructional materials and equipment and assistive technology devices and services, as defined in 511 IAC 7-32-7 and 511 IAC 7-32-8, which are specified in the student's IEP. On a case-by-case basis, the use of school-purchased assistive technology devices in a student's home or in other settings is required if the student's CCC determines that the student needs access to those devices in order to receive a free appropriate public education. 

(l) 
Unless the student's CCC determines otherwise, the public agency is not responsible to provide basic equipment that may be required at home as well as in the educational setting, such as the following:

(d) 
For district assessments, public agencies must develop guidelines for the provision of appropriate accommodations that do not invalidate scores. 

(e) 
The student's CCC must determine, in advance, whether the student will utilize any of the appropriate accommodations described in subsections (c) and (d) during state and district assessments and throughout the student's education program. If the student will utilize accommodations, the CCC must: 

(1) 
select testing accommodations the student needs in order for the assessment to reflect the student's academic achievement; 

(2) 
not select testing accommodations that will invalidate a student's score; and 

(3)

(1) 
Whether the student is eligible for special education and related services. 

(2) 
The content of the student's individual educational program, including information related to enabling the student to be involved in and progress in the general education curriculum (or for an early childhood student, to participate in appropriate activities). 



(g) 
The public agency must evaluate a student with a disability in accordance with the requirements of this rule and 511 IAC 7-41 before a CCC can determine that the student is no longer a student with a disability, except when termination of the student's eligibility is due to:

Sec. 6. (a) Within fifteen (15) calendar days of receiving notice of the parent's due process hearing request, and prior to the initiation of a due process hearing, the public agency must convene a meeting with the parent and the relevant members of the CCC who have specific knowledge of the facts identified in the due process hearing request, as determined by the parent and the public agency. 
(b) 
A public agency does not have to convene a resolution meeting if the due process hearing request was made by the public agency. 

(c) 
The purpose of the resolution meeting is for the parent to discuss the: 

(1) 
due process hearing request; and 



(2) 
facts that form the basis of the request; so that the public agency has the opportunity to resolve the dispute that is the basis of the request. Resolution meetings must be conducted according to this section. 

(d) 
The resolution meeting need not be held if the parents and the public agency agree: 

(1) 
in writing to waive the meeting; or 



(2) 
to use the mediation process described in section 2 of this rule. Mediation does not extend the thirty (30) day resolution process timeline in subsection (f) unless the parties agree in writing to extend the process. 

(e) 
The resolution meeting: 

(1) 
must include a representative of the public agency that has decision making authority on behalf of that agency; and 

(2) 
may not include an attorney of the public agency unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney. 



(f) 
If the public agency has not resolved the dispute that is the basis for the due process hearing request to the satisfaction of the parent within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the due process hearing request, the forty-five (45) day due process hearing timeline in section 7 of this rule will commence.

Both parties agree in writing to waive the resolution meeting. 

(2) 
After either the mediation or resolution meeting starts, but before the end of the thirty (30) day resolution period, the parties agree in writing that no agreement is possible. 

(3) 
Both parties agree in writing to continue the mediation at the end of thirty (30) day resolution period, but later the parent or the public agency withdraws from the mediation process. 



(g) 
Except as provided in subsection (f), the failure of the parent requesting a due process hearing to participate in the resolution meeting will delay the timelines for the: 

(1) resolution process; and 

(2) 
due process hearing; until the meeting is held. 

(h) 
The public agency must keep a record of its attempts to secure the participation of the parent in the resolution meeting, such as the following: 

(1) 
Detailed records of: 

(A) 
telephone calls made or attempted; and 

(B) 
the results of the calls. 



(2) 
Copies of: 

(A) 
correspondence sent to the parent; and 

(B) 
any responses received. 



(3) 
Detailed records of: 

(A) 
visits made to the parent's home or place of employment; and 

(B) 
the results of those visits. 



(i) 
If the public agency is unable to obtain the participation of the parent in the resolution meeting after reasonable efforts 




have been made and documented in accordance with subsection (h), the public agency may, at the conclusion of the thirty (30) day period in subsection (f), request that a hearing officer dismiss the parent's due process hearing request. 
(j) 
If the public agency fails to hold or participate in the resolution meeting specified in subsection (a) within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice of a parent's due process hearing request, the parent may seek the intervention of a hearing officer to begin the forty-five (45) calendar day due process hearing timeline. 

(k) 
If resolution to the dispute is reached at the resolution meeting, the parties must execute a legally binding agreement that is: 

(1) 
signed by both: 

(A) 
the parent; and 

(B) 
a representative of the agency who has the authority to bind the agency; and 



(2) 
enforceable in: 

(A) 
any state court of competent jurisdiction; or 

(B) 
a district court of the United States. 





(l) 
If the parties execute an agreement as a result of a resolution meeting held in accordance with subsection (a), a party may void the agreement by notifying the other person in writing within three (3) business days of the agreement's execution. 


(m)Inadditiontotheenforcementmechanismsinsubsection(k)(2),awritten,signedresolution agreementunder thissection is enforceable through the complaint process in section 1 of this rule. However, use of the complaint process: 
(1)

(t) 
If the issue of the proceedings involves initial enrollment in a public school for a student who is transitioning from Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to Part B of the act, and the student is no longer eligible for Part C services because the student has become three (3) years of age, the public agency is not required to provide the Part C services that the child had been receiving. If the: 

(1) child is found eligible for special education and related services under Part B; and 

(2) 
parent consents to the initial provision of special education and related services; the public agency must provide those special education and related services that are not in dispute between the parent and the public agency. 

(u) 
Except as provided in 511 IAC 7-44-8, the student shall remain in the student's current educational placement during a due process hearing or judicial proceeding, unless the parties agree otherwise. If the:

(b) 
A court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorney's fees and related costs to: 

(1) 
a prevailing party who is the: 

(A) 
parent of a child with a disability; or 

(B) 
department of education or a public agency against the attorney of a parent who: 

(i) 
files a due process hearing request or subsequent cause of action that is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation; or 

(ii) 
continued to litigate after the litigation clearly became frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation; or 





(2) 
the prevailing department of education or the public agency against the attorney of a parent, or against the parent, if the parent's request for a due process hearing or subsequent cause of action was presented for any improper purpose, such as to: 

(A) 
harass; 

(B) 
cause unnecessary delay; or 

(C) 
needlessly increase the cost of litigation. 




(c) 
Attorney's fees awarded shall be based on rates prevailing in the community in which the action or proceeding arose for the kind and quality of services furnished. No bonus or multiplier may be used in calculating the fees awarded. 

(d) 
Attorney's fees may not be awarded and related costs may not be reimbursed in any action or proceeding for services performed subsequent to the time of a written offer of settlement to a parent if:

(g) 
Unless a court finds that the department of education or the public agency unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the action or proceeding or any other violation of this rule, a court reduces, accordingly, the amount of attorney's fees awarded if the court finds any of the following: 

(1) 
During the course of the action or proceeding, the parent, or the parent's attorney, unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy. 

(2) 
The amount of attorney's fees otherwise authorized to be awarded unreasonably exceeds the hourly rate prevailing in the community for similar services by attorneys of comparable skills, reputation, and experience.

Affected: IC 20-19-2; IC 20-35-6-2 

Sec. 1. (a) To the extent that state funds are appropriated, the state superintendent of public instruction is authorized, under IC 20-35-6-2, to enter into contracts to fund the excess costs of educating students whose disabilities are of such intensity as to preclude achievement in the existing local public school setting. Excess cost funding may pay for services that include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1) 
A public or private residential program when services in a residential setting are necessary for the student to benefit from special education. 

(2) 
Nonresidential services necessary to enable the student to remain in the community without resorting to residential placement or to return to the local community from a residential placement. 


(b) 
The division of special education must establish an application process described in a procedure manual that includes requirements for applications of excess cost funding. The division is authorized to revise the procedure manual as needed. 

(c) 
A school corporation of legal settlement or a charter school may apply to the division of special education for excess cost funding when a student's CCC has determined, in accordance with 511 IAC 7-42, that a student requires services involving excess costs. However, nothing in this rule restricts a public agency from utilizing its own resources to pay for excess costs. 

(d) 
When an application for funding of excess costs has been approved, in whole or in part, the superintendent of public instruction will contract, as authorized by IC 20-35-6-2, or arrange an interagency transfer of funds, to pay for excess costs. The school corporation of legal settlement or the charter school must pay a share of the excess costs consisting of its per capita cost of general education, its paraprofessional rate, or transfer tuition. Approval of an application for excess cost funding cannot be retroactive, and expenses incurred prior to the date of approval are not eligible for reimbursement.

Sec. 2. (a) The division of special education's denial of an application for excess cost funding is a denial of funding, not a denial of services. The division of special education's denial is not a disagreement with a student's CCC regarding appropriate services for the student or the provision of a free appropriate public education. A denial means that the application did not: 
(1) 
include required information; or 

(2) 
demonstrate eligibility for excess cost funding. 


(b)
