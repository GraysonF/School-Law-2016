IC 4-10-18-3 Determination of adjusted personal income and annual growth rate 
Sec. 3. (a) Each year, the budget director shall determine the adjusted personal income and the annual growth rate for Indiana using the current reporting period. 
(b) The budget director shall determine the adjusted personal 
income for the current reporting period in the following manner: STEP ONE: Calculate the average implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product for the current reporting period by totaling the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product for each quarter of the current reporting period and dividing that total by four (4). STEP TWO: Calculate the remainder of the total state personal income for the current reporting period minus any transfer payments made in Indiana for the current reporting period.

This product is the adjusted personal income for the current reporting period. 
(c) The annual growth rate for a particular reporting period equals the quotient of: 
(1) 
the remainder of: 

(A) 
the adjusted personal income for the particular reporting period; minus

the adjusted personal income for the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the current reporting period; divided by 



(2)

the annual growth rate for the current reporting period; 

minus

two percent (2%).

STEP ONE: Determine the product of: 
(A) the total state general fund revenues for the state fiscal year ending in the current calendar year; multiplied by 
(B) negative one (-1). 
STEP TWO: Determine the product of:

If an appropriation is made out of the fund under section 4 of this chapter, the budget director shall certify to the treasurer of state an amount equal to the part of the appropriation, if any, by which the general fund general operating budget, for the state fiscal year for which the appropriation is made, exceeds the budget director's estimate of the total general fund revenues for that same state fiscal year. The budget director shall make the certification or certifications of money to be transferred out of the fund at the time or times that the budget director determines the general fund general operating budget would exceed the total estimated state general fund revenues. 

(c) 
Immediately upon receiving a certification from the budget director under subsection (b), the auditor of state and treasurer of state shall make the appropriate transfer into or out of the fund. 

(d)

(1) 
the bureau revises the state personal income figure it has previously reported for the twelve (12) month period preceding the current reporting period; and 

(2) 
the revision is made after the transfer for the state fiscal year that begins in the current calendar year has initially been determined under section 5 of this chapter; 


then the budget director shall adjust the transfer to reflect any increase or decrease in the growth rate used in initially determining that transfer. However, the total adjustments made under this section may not increase or decrease the initially determined transfer by an amount which exceeds one percent (1%) of the total general fund revenue used in determining the transfer. In addition, the last report of state personal income that the bureau makes before April 30 of the calendar year immediately following the current calendar year determines the final adjustment that may be made under this section with respect to that transfer.

If the total state general fund revenues for a state fiscal year, in which a transfer into the fund is made, are less than the level estimated in the budget report prepared in accord with IC 4-12-1-12(a) or (c) and the shortfall cannot be attributed to a statutory change in the tax rate, the tax base, the fee schedules, or the revenue sources from which the general fund revenue estimate was made, there is appropriated from the fund to the state general fund an amount that may not exceed the lesser of the following two (2) amounts: 
(1)
