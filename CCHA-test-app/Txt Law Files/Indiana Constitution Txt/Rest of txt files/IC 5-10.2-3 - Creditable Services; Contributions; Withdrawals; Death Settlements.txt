No member may be required to pay any contributions for service before the member is covered by this article as a condition precedent to receiving benefits under this article. However, the member must furnish to the board proof of the service in a position covered by the fund under which the member claims service. 

(c) 
A member who has past service as an employee of the state or a participating political subdivision in a position which was not covered by the retirement fund is entitled to credit for this service if the position becomes covered before January 1, 1985, by the Indiana state teachers'retirement fund, the public employees'retirement fund, or the retirement fund for the state board of accounts and if the member submits to the board proof of the service in a position covered by the fund in which the member claims service.

A member who has past service in a position that was not covered by the retirement fund is entitled to credit for this service if the position becomes covered after December 31, 1984, by a fund while the member holds that position or another position with the same employer and if the member submits to the board proof of the service in a position covered by the fund in which the member claims service.

(A) 
at least ten (10) years of creditable service, if the member died in service as a member of the general assembly;

at least ten (10) years of creditable service, if the member died in service as a member of the general assembly;

(2) 
the surviving dependent or surviving spouse qualifies for a survivor benefit under subsection (c) or (d). 



(c) 
If a member described in subsection (a) or (b) dies with a surviving spouse who was married to the member for at least two (2) years, the surviving spouse is entitled to a survivor benefit equal to the monthly pension benefit that would have been payable to the spouse under the joint and survivor option of IC 5-10.2-4-7 upon the member's death following retirement at: 

(1) fifty (50) years of age; or 

(2) 
the actual date of death; whichever is later. However, benefits payable under this subsection are subject to subsections (f) and (h). 

(d) 
If a member described in subsection (a) or (b) dies without a surviving spouse who was married to the member for at least two (2) years, but with a surviving dependent, the surviving dependent is entitled to a survivor benefit in a monthly amount equal to the actuarial equivalent of the monthly pension benefit that would have been payable to the spouse (assuming the spouse would have had the same birth date as the member) under the joint and survivor option of IC 5-10.2-4-7 upon the member's death following retirement at: 

(1) fifty (50) years of age; or

(2) 
If the member is survived by two (2) or more designated beneficiaries, the designated beneficiaries are entitled to receive in a lump sum or over a period of up to five (5) years, as elected by the designated beneficiary, equal shares of the amount credited to the member's annuity savings account unless the member has allocated the shares among the designated beneficiaries in a manner authorized under IC 5-10.3-8-15 or IC 5-10.4-4-10, less any disability benefits paid to the member. 

(3) 
If the member is also survived by a spouse or dependent who is entitled to a survivor benefit under subsection (c) or (d) or section 7.6 of this chapter, the surviving spouse or dependent is not entitled to an annuity or a lump sum payment as part of the survivor benefit, unless the surviving spouse or dependent is also a designated beneficiary. 




(g) If a member dies: 
(1) 
without a surviving spouse or surviving dependent who qualifies for survivor benefits under subsection (c) or (d) or section 7.6 of this chapter; and

(h) 
Survivor benefits payable under this section or section 7.6 of this chapter shall be reduced by any disability benefits paid to the member. 

(i) 
Additional annuity contributions, if any, shall not be included in determining survivor benefits under subsection (c) or (d) or section 7.6 of this chapter, but are payable in a lump sum payment to: 

(1) 
the member's surviving designated beneficiary; or 

(2) 
the member's estate, if there is no surviving designated 




beneficiary. 
(j) 
Survivor benefits provided under this section or section 7.6 of this chapter are subject to IC 5-10.2-2-1.5. 

(k) 
A benefit specified in this section shall be forfeited and credited to the member's retirement fund if no person entitled to the benefit claims it within three (3) years after the member's death. However, the board may honor a claim that is made more than three 

(3) 
years after the member's death if the board finds, in the board's discretion, that: 

(1) 
the delay in making the claim was reasonable or other extenuating circumstances justify the award of the benefit to the claimant; and 

(2) 
paying the claim would not cause a violation of the applicable Internal Revenue Service rules.

the actual date of death; 




whichever is later. If there are two (2) or more surviving dependents, the actuarial equivalent of the benefit described in this subsection shall be calculated and, considering the dependents' attained ages, an equal dollar amount shall be determined as the monthly benefit to be paid to each dependent. Monthly benefits under this subsection are payable until the date the dependent becomes eighteen (18) years of age or dies, whichever is earlier. However, if a dependent has a permanent and total disability (using disability guidelines established by the Social Security Administration) on the date the dependent becomes eighteen (18) years of age, the monthly benefit is payable until the date the dependent no longer has a disability (using disability guidelines established by the Social Security Administration) or dies, whichever is earlier. Benefits payable under this section are subject to section 7.5(f) and 7.5(h) of this chapter.
