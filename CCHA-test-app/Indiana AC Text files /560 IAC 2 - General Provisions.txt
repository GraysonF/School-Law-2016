For this purpose the parties shall consist of the school employer and a school employee organization representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the school employees in any proposed unit. 
(b) 
Unit determination. If no such agreement is reached or if any school employee in the proposed unit files a complaint (as in 560 IAC 2-2-3(a) and 560 IAC 2-2-4(b) [sections 3(a) and 4(b) of this rule]) to the composition of such unit with the board, the board shall determine the proper unit in accordance with IC 20-7.5-1-10(a)(2) or IC 20-7.5-1-10(c)(4). The board or its agent may make a determination based upon briefs and papers filed unless a hearing is requested. 

(c) 
Unit amendment or unit clarification. A school employer and a school employee organization may agree to amend or clarify a unit at any time. A unit amendment is appropriate when a position has been newly created and is to be added to or excluded from the existing unit. A unit clarification is appropriate when an existing position is to be added to or excluded from the existing unit. If such an amendment or clarification is mutually made, the school employer and exclusive representative shall post notice of the amendment or clarification in each school building for no less than thirty (30) days; provided, however, that if the amendment or clarification is made in a period when school employees are not in attendance, notice shall be made to each by mail to his last known place of residence. Said notice shall clearly show the description of the existing bargaining unit and the proposed amendment or clarification. The notice shall state the current address and telephone number of the board and state that objections to the amendment or clarification by any affected school employee may be made to the board within thirty (30) days of the first date of posting or of the mailing of the notice. If a school employee affected by the amendment or clarification objects to the amendment or clarification, the board shall determine the unit by the same procedures used in original determinations of the unit. At the end of the posting period or thirty (30) days after the mailing of notice, and if no objections have been filed, a copy of the notice of amendment or clarification shall be furnished to the board. An incorrect posting as to whether the position is an amendment to or clarification of a unit shall not operate to void the notice or results thereof, regardless of objections.

(b) 
Issuance of certification and closing. If no objections are filed within the time set forth in 560 IAC 2-2-9(i) [section 9(i) of this rule], if the challenged ballots are insufficient in number to affect the result of the election, if no runoff is to be held pursuant to 560 IAC 2-2-10 [section 10 of this rule], or if no rerun resulted as provided in 560 IAC 2-2-11 [section 11 of this rule], the chairman shall forthwith issue to the parties a certification of results of the election or a certification of the exclusive representative with the same force and effect as if issued by the board; and the proceeding will thereupon be closed.

Sec. 13. (a) Where a valid election has been held in a bargaining unit in the preceding twenty-four (24) months, no petition for a subsequent election may be filed until sixty (60) days before the second anniversary of the first ballot in the election; and no election shall be conducted until at least twenty-four (24) months after the first ballot in the previous election. 
(b) 
If board investigation under section 3(f) of this rule shows that a school employee organization has been duly recognized under procedures conforming to IC 20-7.5-1-10(b) within the preceding twelve (12) months, any petition filed under section 3 of 

this rule shall be dismissed. 

(c) 
A representation petition shall be held in abeyance where an unfair practice complaint is filed alleging that the school employer violated IC 20-7.5-1-7(a)(2) by dominating, interfering, or assisting in the formation or administration of the school employee organization. The complaint for unfair practice must specifically request that the election be stayed. If an IC 20-7.5-1­7(a)(2) violation is alleged in the complaint and the complaint requests a stay of the election, proceedings on the representation petition shall be stayed until a determination of the unfair practice complaint is made under proceedings provided for unfair practices. The IC 20-7.5-1-7(a)(2) complaint shall be given priority over other unfair practice complaints. The board or its agent may proceed with the representation petition where: 

(1) 
the complaining party in the unfair practice complaint requests that the election proceed; 

(2) 
the unfair practice complaint does not request the election be stayed and the board or its agent determines that school employees would be able to freely exercise their choice; or 



(3) 
the unfair practice complaint is filed too late to permit an investigation of the complaint before the scheduled election. The board or its agent may consolidate representation proceedings with the unfair practice proceedings. All hearings provided for in sections 6 and 7 of this rule shall be conducted by a hearing examiner as provided for in 560 IAC 2-3-1 through 560 IAC 2-3-5.

A collective bargaining agreement having a term in excess of two (2) years shall be treated as an agreement for a term of two (2) years from its date of execution. A collective bargaining agreement for an indefinite term shall be treated as a one (1) year agreement measured from the date of execution. Extensions of any collective bargaining agreement shall not extend the period of unchallengeable representation status. In addition, any such collective bargaining agreement entered into after the effective date of this amendment to this section, and executed within the twenty-four (24) month period immediately subsequent to a previous valid election, shall not operate as a bar to a representation petition. 

(e) 
The election bar in subsection (a), the recognition bar in subsection (b), a pending unfair practice complaint in subsection (c), and a contract bar in subsection (d) shall not operate to bar proceedings initiated by a petition for unit clarification or a petition for unit amendment. No petition may be filed for a unit clarification where the board has made a unit clarification decision within the previous twelve (12) months. A petition for unit amendment may be filed at any time, and the twelve (12) month rule shall not apply.
