IC 5-10.2-4-2 Annuity or distribution benefits; choice of plans; payment of final contributions 
Sec. 2. (a) Unless a member elects otherwise under this section or has elected to withdraw the member's annuity savings account under IC 5-10.2-3-6.5, the retirement benefit for each member consists of the sum of a pension provided by employer contributions plus an annuity provided by the amount credited to the member in the annuity savings account. If a member has elected to withdraw the member's annuity savings account under IC 5-10.2-3-6.5, the member's retirement benefit is equal to the pension provided by employer contributions, unless the member has transferred the creditable service earnedunder the public employees' retirement fund to another governmental retirement plan under IC 5-10.2-3-1(i). Regardless of a member's election under this section, contributions that are posted to a member's annuity savings account after the final date on which the member's retirement benefit is processed may be distributed to the member as determined by the rules of the board. If the distribution exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000), the board shall obtain the member's consent as to the form of the distribution. 
(b) If a member has not elected to withdraw the entire amount in the member's annuity savings account under IC 5-10.2-3-6.5, a member may choose at retirement or upon a disability retirement to receive a distribution of: 
(1) 
the entire amount credited to the member in the annuity savings account; or 

(2) 
an amount equal to the member's federal income tax basis in the member's annuity savings account balance as it existed on December 31, 1986. 


If the member chooses to receive the distribution under subdivision (1), the member is not entitled to an annuity as part of the retirement or disability benefit. If the member chooses to receive the distribution under subdivision (2), the member is entitled to an annuity purchasable by the amount remaining in the member's annuity savings account after the payment under subdivision (2). 
(c) Instead of choosing to receive the benefits described in subsection (a) or (b), if a member has not elected to withdraw the entire amount in the member's annuity savings account under IC 5-10.2-3-6.5, a member may choose upon retirement or upon disability retirement to begin receiving a pension provided by employer contributions and to defer receiving in any form the member's annuity savings account. If a member chooses this option, the member: 
(1) 
is not entitled to an annuity as part of the member's retirement or disability benefit, and the member's annuity savings account will continue to be invested according to the member's direction under IC 5-10.2-2-3; and 

(2) 
may later choose, as of the first day of a month, or an alternate date established by the rules of the board, to receive a distribution of: 

(A) 
the entire amount credited to the member in the annuity savings account; or 

(B) 
an amount equal to the member's federal income tax basis in the member's annuity savings account balance as it existed on December 31, 1986. 




If the member chooses to receive the distribution under subdivision (2)(A), the member is not entitled to an annuity as part of the member's retirement or disability benefit. If the member chooses to receive the distribution under subdivision (2)(B), the member is entitled to an annuity purchasable by the amount remaining in the member's annuity savings account after the payment under subdivision (2)(B). If the member does not choose to receive a distribution under this subsection, the member is entitled to an annuity purchasable by the entire amount in the member's annuity savings account, and the form of the annuity shall be as described in subsection (d) unless the member elects an option described in section 7(b)(1), 7(b)(2), or 7(b)(4) of this chapter. The amount to be paid under this section shall be determined in the manner described in IC 5-10.2-2-3. However, the board may by rule provide for an alternate valuation date. 
(d) Retirement benefits must be distributed in a manner that complies with Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code, as specified in IC 5-10.2-2-1.5. As added by Acts 1977, P.L.53, SEC.2. Amended by P.L.35-1985, SEC.12; P.L.55-1989, SEC.16; P.L.59-1989, SEC.1; P.L.195-1999, SEC.15; P.L.62-2005, SEC.2; P.L.115-2008, SEC.11; P.L.115-2009, SEC.6; P.L.35-2012, SEC.42; P.L.22-2014, SEC.1. 

IC 5-10.2-4-3 Average of the annual compensation 
Sec. 3. (a) Except as provided in subsection (f), in computing the retirement benefit for a nonteacher member, "average of the annual compensation" means the average annual compensation calculated using the twenty (20) calendar quarters of service in a position covered by the retirement fund before retirement in which the member's annual compensation was the highest. However, in order for a quarter to be included in the twenty (20) calendar quarters, the nonteacher member must have performed service throughout the calendar quarter. All twenty (20) calendar quarters do not have to be continuous but they must be in groups of four (4) consecutive calendar quarters. The same calendar quarter may not be included in two (2) different groups. 
(b) 
This subsection does not apply to a teacher member described in subsection (c). In computing the retirement benefit for a teacher member, "average of the annual compensation" means the average annual compensation for the five (5) years of service before retirement in which the member's annual compensation was highest. In order for a year to be included in the five (5) years, the teacher member must have received for the year credit under IC 5-10.4-4-2 for at least one-half (1/2) year of service. The five (5) years do not have to be continuous. 

(c) 
This subsection applies to a member of the Indiana state teachers' retirement fund who serves in an elected position for which the member takes an unpaid leave of absence. In computing the retirement benefit for a teacher member described in this subsection for years of service to which IC 5-10.4-5-7 does not apply, "average of the annual compensation" means the annual compensation for the one (1) year of service before retirement in which the member's annual compensation was highest. In order for a year to be used, the teacher member must have received for the year credit under IC 5-10.4-4-2 for at least one-half (1/2) year of service. 


(d) Subject to IC 5-10.2-2-1.5, "annual compensation" means: 
(1) 
the basic salary earned by and paid to the member plus the amount that would have been part of that salary but for: 

(A) 
the state's, a school corporation's, a participating political subdivision's, or a state educational institution's paying the member's contribution to the fund for the member; or 

(B) 
the member's salary reduction agreement established under Section 125, 403(b), or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code; and 



(2) 
in the case of a member described in subsection (c) and for years of service to which IC 5-10.4-5-7 does not apply, the basic salary that was not paid during the year but would have been paid to the member during the year under the member's employment contracts, if the member had not taken any unpaid leave of absence to serve in an elected position. 


The portion of a back pay award or a similar award that the board determines is compensation under an agreement or under a judicial or an administrative proceeding shall be allocated by the board among the years the member earned or should have earned the compensation. Only that portion of the award allocated to the year the award is made is considered to have been earned during the year the award was made. Interest on an award is not considered annual compensation for any year. 
(e) Compensation of not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000) received from the employer in contemplation of the member's retirement, including severance pay, termination pay, retirement bonus, or commutation of unused sick leave or personal leave, may be included in the total annual compensation from which the average of the annual compensation is determined, if it is received: 
(1) 
before the member ceases service; or 

(2) 
within twelve (12) months after the member ceases service. 


(f) This subsection applies to a member of the general assembly: 
(1) 
who is a participant in the legislators' retirement system established under IC 2-3.5; 

(2) 
who is also a member of the public employees' retirement fund or the Indiana state teachers' retirement fund; and 

(3) 
whose years of service in the general assembly may not be considered in determining the average of the annual compensation under this section, as provided in IC 2-3.5-1-2(b)(2) or IC 2-3.5-3-1(c). 


The board shall use the board's actuarial salary increase assumption to project the salary for any previous year needed to determine the average of the annual compensation.

IC 5-10.2-4-3.1 Compensation from two or more employers; computation of average 
Sec. 3.1. For a member who receives annual compensation from two (2) or more employers, the average of the annual compensation shall be computed using the sum of the two (2) or more annual compensations if: 
(1) 
each of the employers and the member made all of the contributions required by IC 5-10.2; and 

(2) 
the member occupied at least one (1) position that normally required performance of service of more than six hundred (600) hours during the year. 


As added by P.L.381-1987(ss), SEC.1. 

IC 5-10.2-4-4 Retirement benefit computation 
Sec. 4. (a) The computation of benefits under this section is subject to IC 5-10.2-2-1.5. 
(b) For retirement benefits payable on and after July 1, 1975, for a member retired on and after January 1, 1956, the pension (p) is computed as follows: 
STEP ONE: Multiply one and one-tenths percent (1.1%) times 
the average of the annual compensation (aac) and obtain a 
product. 
STEP TWO: To obtain the pension, multiply the STEP ONE 
product by the total creditable service (scr) completed by the 
member on the member's retirement date. 
Expressed mathematically: 
p = (.011) times (aac) times (scr) 

(c) Unless the member: 
(1) 
has chosen a lump sum payment under section 2(b) of this chapter; 

(2) 
has elected to withdraw the entire amount in the member's annuity savings account under IC 5-10.2-3-6.5; or 

(3) 
elects to defer receiving in any form the member's annuity 


savings account under section 2(c) of this chapter; the annuity is the amount purchasable on the member's retirement date by the amount credited to the member in the annuity savings account. The amount purchasable is based onactuarial tables adopted by the board under IC 5-10.2-2-10 at an interest rate determined by the board under IC 5-10.5-4-2.6. As added by Acts 1977, P.L.53, SEC.2. Amended by Acts 1980, P.L.28, SEC.6; P.L.35-1985, SEC.14; P.L.45-1988, SEC.1; P.L.55-1989, SEC.18; P.L.195-1999, SEC.16; P.L.115-2008, SEC.12; P.L.177-2014, SEC.3. 
IC 5-10.2-4-5 Early retirement percent reduction 
Sec. 5. The retirement benefit (rb) payable on and after July 1, 1975, for a member who retired on and after January 1, 1956, before age sixty-five (65) is the sum of the pension (P), as specified in section 4 of this chapter and computed on the basis of the total creditable service and the average of the annual compensation at retirement, multiplied by a percent (p), plus the annuity (A), if any, purchasable by the amount credited to the member in the annuity savings account. This sum is obtained by the following STEPS: 
STEP ONE: From seven hundred eighty (780) months, which 
equals sixty-five (65) years, subtract the age of the member at 
his retirement date expressed in whole months (retirement age 
in months) and obtain a remainder (X). 
STEP TWO: 
(i) 
If the remainder (X) is less than or equal to sixty (60), then multiply the remainder (X) times one-tenth percent (0.1%) and obtain a product (Y). 

(ii) 
If the remainder (X) is greater than sixty (60), then multiply five-twelfths percent (5/12%) times the difference obtained by subtracting sixty (60) from the remainder (X) and obtain a product. Add to this six percent (6%) and obtain a sum (Y). 


STEP THREE: From one hundred percent (100%) subtract the 
appropriate (Y) and obtain the percent (p). 
STEP FOUR: The early retirement benefit equals (p) times (P) 
plus the annuity (A). 
Expressed mathematically: 
If "<" means "less than or equal to" and if ">" means "greater 
than"; then: 

(I)
 780 - (retire age in months) = X; 

(II)
 if X < 60, (X) times (0.1%) = Y; or 
if X > 60, (5/12%) times (X-60) + 6% = Y 



(III) 100% - Y = p 
(IV) rb = pP + A As added by Acts 1977, P.L.53, SEC.2. Amended by P.L.35-1985, SEC.15.

(1) 
the member has at least five (5) years of creditable service before the: 

(A)

(B) 
exhaustion of all worker's compensation benefits; 



(2) 
the member has qualified for Social Security disability benefits and has furnished proof of the Social Security qualification to the board; and

at least once each year until the member reaches age sixty-five (65) a representative of the board verifies the continued disability. 


For the purposes of this section, a member of the public employees' retirement fund who has qualified for disability benefits under the federal civil service system is considered to have met the requirement of subdivision (2) if the member furnishes proof of the qualification to the board. 
(b) 
Benefits for disability shall be paid beginning with the month following the onset of disability as determined by the Social Security Administration. The benefit is the retirement benefit specified in section 4 of this chapter with the pension computed using only the years of creditable service worked to the date of disability and without reduction for early retirement. The monthly disability retirement benefit payable before July 1, 2008, may not be less than one hundred dollars ($100). The monthly disability retirement benefit payable after June 30, 2008, may not be less than one hundred eighty dollars ($180). 

(c) 
The member may have the member's benefit paid under any of the retirement benefit options specified in section 7 of this chapter, except that the member may not choose to have the member's disability retirement benefit paid under the method specified under section 7(b)(3) of this chapter.

of Social Security eligibility and decreased retirement benefits after that age. 

(4) 
Cash Refund Annuity. The member receives a lifetime annuity purchasable by the amount credited to the member in the annuity savings account, and the member's designated beneficiary receives a refund payment equal to:
