IC 20-45-7-2 Policy 
Sec. 2. The following is declared to be the policy of this chapter: 
(1) 
That in certain areas in Indiana there exists a condition created by the shift in population from urban centers to outlying areas that has created administrative and financial problems in the maintenance and operation of school systems in these areas, resulting in maladjustment of taxable wealth in these areas for levying taxes for the operation of the schools. 

(2) 
That improvement in the administrative and financial structures of the qualified school corporations existing in these outlying areas to the urban centers is essential for the following: 

(A) 
The establishment and maintenance of a general uniform and efficient system of public schools to provide a more equalized educational opportunity for public school pupils. 

(B) 
The achievement of greater equity in school tax rates among the inhabitants of the various existing qualified school corporations in these areas. 

(C) 
The provision for more use of the public funds expended for the support of the public school system. 



(3) 
That existing statutes with respect to the granting of financial assistance on a countywide basis, allowing a more favorable use of the taxable wealth of the county for the support of the various school districts within the county, are inadequate to effectuate the need for this improvement in those areas. 

(4) 
That modification in the present statutory provisions pertaining to the levying of tax rates for school purposes for the areas that qualify within the definitions in this chapter is essential to carry out the purposes of IC 20-23-4, and to that end it is the intent of the general assembly, by this chapter, to make provision for a more satisfactory use of the taxable wealth of counties that qualify under this chapter for the promotion, betterment, and improvement of their educational systems.
