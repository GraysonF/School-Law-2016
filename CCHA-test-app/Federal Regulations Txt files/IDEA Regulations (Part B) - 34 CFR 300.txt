(2) Who, by reason thereof, needs special education and related services.
(c) Definitions of disability terms. The
terms used in this definition of a child
with a disability are defined as follows:
(1)(i) Autism means a developmental
disability significantly affecting verbal
and nonverbal communication and social interaction, generally evident before age three, that adversely affects a
child’s educational performance. Other
characteristics often associated with
autism are engagement in repetitive
activities and stereotyped movements,
resistance to environmental change or
change in daily routines, and unusual
responses to sensory experiences.
(ii) Autism does not apply if a child’s
educational performance is adversely
affected primarily because the child
has an emotional disturbance, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
(iii) A child who manifests the characteristics of autism after age three
could be identified as having autism if
the criteria in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of
this section are satisfied.
(2) Deaf-blindness means concomitant
hearing and visual impairments, the
combination of which causes such severe communication and other developmental and educational needs that
they cannot be accommodated in special education programs solely for children with deafness or children with
blindness.
(3) Deafness means a hearing impairment that is so severe that the child is
impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, with or without amplification, that adversely affects a child’s educational performance.
(4)(i) Emotional disturbance means a
condition exhibiting one or more of the
following characteristics over a long
period of time and to a marked degree
that adversely affects a child’s educational performance:
(A) An inability to learn that cannot
be explained by intellectual, sensory,
or health factors.
(B) An inability to build or maintain
satisfactory interpersonal relationships with peers and teachers.
(C) Inappropriate types of behavior or
feelings under normal circumstances.
(D) A general pervasive mood of unhappiness or depression.

§ 300.7 Charter school.
Charter school has the meaning given
the term in section 5210(1) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act
of 1965, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 6301 et
seq. (ESEA).

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 7221i(1))

§ 300.8 Child with a disability.
(a) General. (1) Child with a disability
means a child evaluated in accordance
with §§ 300.304 through 300.311 as having
mental retardation, a hearing impairment (including deafness), a speech or
language impairment, a visual impairment (including blindness), a serious
emotional disturbance (referred to in
this part as ‘‘emotional disturbance’’),
an orthopedic impairment, autism,
traumatic brain injury, an other health
impairment, a specific learning disability, deaf-blindness, or multiple disabilities, and who, by reason thereof,
needs special education and related
services.
(2)(i) Subject to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of
this section, if it is determined,
through an appropriate evaluation
under §§ 300.304 through 300.311, that a
child has one of the disabilities identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section,
but only needs a related service and
not special education, the child is not a
child with a disability under this part.
(ii) If, consistent with § 300.39(a)(2),
the related service required by the
child is considered special education
rather than a related service under
State standards, the child would be determined to be a child with a disability
under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
(b) Children aged three through nine
experiencing developmental delays. Child
with a disability for children aged three
through nine (or any subset of that age
range, including ages three through
five), may, subject to the conditions
described in § 300.111(b), include a
child—
(1) Who is experiencing developmental delays, as defined by the State
and as measured by appropriate diagnostic instruments and procedures, in
one or more of the following areas:
Physical development, cognitive development, communication development,
social or emotional development, or
adaptive development; and

aged 3 through 21 who are enrolled by
their parents in private, including religious, elementary schools and secondary schools located in the school
district served by the LEA, is to the
total number of children with disabilities in its jurisdiction aged 3 through
21.
(2)(i) For children aged three through
five, an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA’s total subgrant
under section 619(g) of the Act as the
number of parentally-placed private
school children with disabilities aged

CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES ENROLLED
BY
THEIR PARENTS IN PRIVATE
SCHOOLS WHEN FAPE IS AT ISSUE
§ 300.148 Placement of children by
parents when FAPE is at issue.
(a) General. This part does not require an LEA to pay for the cost of
education, including special education
and related services, of a child with a
disability at a private school or facility if that agency made FAPE available to the child and the parents elected to place the child in a private school
or facility. However, the public agency
must include that child in the population whose needs are addressed consistent with §§ 300.131 through 300.144.
(b) Disagreements about FAPE. Disagreements between the parents and a
public agency regarding the availability of a program appropriate for
the child, and the question of financial
reimbursement, are subject to the due
process procedures in §§ 300.504 through
300.520.
(c) Reimbursement for private school
placement. If the parents of a child with
a disability, who previously received
special education and related services
under the authority of a public agency,
enroll the child in a private preschool,
elementary school, or secondary school
without the consent of or referral by
the public agency, a court or a hearing
officer may require the agency to reimburse the parents for the cost of that
enrollment if the court or hearing officer finds that the agency had not made
FAPE available to the child in a timely
manner prior to that enrollment and
that the private placement is appropriate. A parental placement may be
found to be appropriate by a hearing
officer or a court even if it does not
meet the State standards that apply to
education provided by the SEA and
LEAs.

§ 300.154 Methods of ensuring services.
(a) Establishing responsibility for services. The Chief Executive Officer of a
State or designee of that officer must
ensure that an interagency agreement
or other mechanism for interagency coordination is in effect between each
noneducational public agency described in paragraph (b) of this section
and the SEA, in order to ensure that
all services described in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section that are needed to
ensure FAPE are provided, including
the provision of these services during
the pendency of any dispute under
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The
agreement or mechanism must include
the following:

service for Medicaid reimbursement because that service is provided in a
school context.
(2) If a public agency other than an
educational agency fails to provide or
pay for the special education and related services described in paragraph
(b)(1) of this section, the LEA (or State
agency responsible for developing the
child’s IEP) must provide or pay for
these services to the child in a timely
manner. The LEA or State agency is
authorized to claim reimbursement for
the services from the noneducational
public agency that failed to provide or
pay for these services and that agency
must reimburse the LEA or State agency in accordance with the terms of the
interagency agreement or other mechanism described in paragraph (a) of this
section.
(c) Special rule. The requirements of
paragraph (a) of this section may be
met through—
(1) State statute or regulation;
(2) Signed agreements between respective agency officials that clearly
identify the responsibilities of each
agency relating to the provision of
services; or
(3) Other appropriate written methods as determined by the Chief Executive Officer of the State or designee of
that officer and approved by the Secretary.
(d) Children with disabilities who are
covered by public benefits or insurance.
(1) A public agency may use the Medicaid or other public benefits or insurance programs in which a child participates to provide or pay for services required under this part, as permitted
under the public benefits or insurance
program, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
(2) With regard to services required
to provide FAPE to an eligible child
under this part, the public agency—
(i) May not require parents to sign up
for or enroll in public benefits or insurance programs in order for their child
to receive FAPE under Part B of the
Act;
(ii) May not require parents to incur
an out-of-pocket expense such as the
payment of a deductible or co-pay
amount incurred in filing a claim for
services provided pursuant to this part,
but pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this

section, may pay the cost that the parents otherwise would be required to
pay;
(iii) May not use a child’s benefits
under a public benefits or insurance
program if that use would—
(A) Decrease available lifetime coverage or any other insured benefit;
(B) Result in the family paying for
services that would otherwise be covered by the public benefits or insurance
program and that are required for the
child outside of the time the child is in
school;
(C) Increase premiums or lead to the
discontinuation of benefits or insurance; or
(D) Risk loss of eligibility for home
and community-based waivers, based
on aggregate health-related expenditures; and
(iv)(A) Must obtain parental consent,
consistent with § 300.9, each time that
access to public benefits or insurance is
sought; and
(B) Notify parents that the parents’
refusal to allow access to their public
benefits or insurance does not relieve
the public agency of its responsibility
to ensure that all required services are
provided at no cost to the parents.
(e) Children with disabilities who are
covered by private insurance. (1) With regard to services required to provide
FAPE to an eligible child under this
part, a public agency may access the
parents’ private insurance proceeds
only if the parents provide consent
consistent with § 300.9.
(2) Each time the public agency proposes to access the parents’ private insurance proceeds, the agency must—
(i) Obtain parental consent in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section; and
(ii) Inform the parents that their refusal to permit the public agency to access their private insurance does not
relieve the public agency of its responsibility to ensure that all required
services are provided at no cost to the
parents.
(f) Use of Part B funds. (1) If a public
agency is unable to obtain parental
consent to use the parents’ private insurance, or public benefits or insurance
when the parents would incur a cost for
a specified service required under this
part, to ensure FAPE the public agency

may use its Part B funds to pay for the
service.
(2) To avoid financial cost to parents
who otherwise would consent to use
private insurance, or public benefits or
insurance if the parents would incur a
cost, the public agency may use its
Part B funds to pay the cost that the
parents otherwise would have to pay to
use the parents’ benefits or insurance
(e.g.,
the
deductible
or
co-pay
amounts).
(g) Proceeds from public benefits or insurance or private insurance. (1) Proceeds from public benefits or insurance
or private insurance will not be treated
as program income for purposes of 34
CFR 80.25.
(2) If a public agency spends reimbursements from Federal funds (e.g.,
Medicaid) for services under this part,
those funds will not be considered
‘‘State or local’’ funds for purposes of
the maintenance of effort provisions in
§§ 300.163 and 300.203.
(h) Construction. Nothing in this part
should be construed to alter the requirements imposed on a State Medicaid agency, or any other agency administering a public benefits or insurance program by Federal statute, regulations or policy under title XIX, or
title XXI of the Social Security Act, 42
U.S.C. 1396 through 1396v and 42 U.S.C.

(b) Related services personnel and paraprofessionals. The qualifications under
paragraph (a) of this section must include qualifications for related services
personnel and paraprofessionals that—
(1) Are consistent with any State-approved or State-recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other
comparable requirements that apply to
the professional discipline in which
those personnel are providing special
education or related services; and
(2) Ensure that related services personnel who deliver services in their discipline or profession—
(i) Meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and
(ii) Have not had certification or licensure requirements waived on an
emergency, temporary, or provisional

(iii) Allow paraprofessionals and assistants who are appropriately trained
and supervised, in accordance with
State law, regulation, or written policy, in meeting the requirements of
this part to be used to assist in the provision of special education and related
services under this part to children
with disabilities.
(c) Qualifications for special education
teachers. The qualifications described
in paragraph (a) of this section must

(d) Explanation to IEP Teams. A State
(or in the case of a district-wide assessment, an LEA) must provide IEP
Teams with a clear explanation of the
differences between assessments based
on grade-level academic achievement
standards and those based on modified
or alternate academic achievement
standards, including any effects of
State or local policies on the student’s
education resulting from taking an alternate assessment based on alternate
or modified academic achievement
standards (such as whether only satisfactory performance on a regular assessment would qualify a student for a
regular high school diploma).
(e) Inform parents. A State (or in the
case of a district-wide assessment, an
LEA) must ensure that parents of students selected to be assessed based on
alternate
or
modified
academic
achievement standards are informed

academic achievement standards.
(3) The number of children with disabilities, if any, participating in alternate assessments based on modified
academic achievement standards.

(a) Except as provided under §§ 300.202
through 300.205, funds paid to a State
under Part B of the Act must be used
to supplement and increase the level of
Federal, State, and local funds (including funds that are not under the direct
control of SEAs or LEAs) expended for
special education and related services
provided to children with disabilities
under Part B of the Act and in no case
to supplant those Federal, State, and
local funds. A State may use funds it
retains under § 300.704(a) and (b) without regard to the prohibition on supplanting other funds.
(b) If a State provides clear and convincing evidence that all eligible children with disabilities throughout the
State have FAPE available to them,
the Secretary may waive for a period of
one year in whole or in part the requirement under § 300.162 (regarding
State-level nonsupplanting) if the Secretary concurs with the evidence provided by the State.
(c) If a State wishes to request a
waiver under this section, it must submit to the Secretary a written request
that includes—
(1) An assurance that FAPE is currently available, and will remain available throughout the period that a waiver would be in effect, to all eligible
children with disabilities throughout
the State, regardless of the public
agency that is responsible for providing
FAPE to them. The assurance must be
signed by an official who has the authority to provide that assurance as it
applies to all eligible children with disabilities in the State;
(2) All evidence that the State wishes
the Secretary to consider in determining whether all eligible children
with disabilities have FAPE available
to them, setting forth in detail—
(i) The basis on which the State has
concluded that FAPE is available to all
eligible children in the State; and

§ 300.163 Maintenance of State financial support.
(a) General. A State must not reduce
the amount of State financial support
for special education and related services for children with disabilities, or
otherwise made available because of
the excess costs of educating those
children, below the amount of that support for the preceding fiscal year.
(b) Reduction of funds for failure to
maintain support. The Secretary reduces the allocation of funds under section 611 of the Act for any fiscal year
following the fiscal year in which the
State fails to comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section by
the same amount by which the State
fails to meet the requirement.
(c) Waivers for exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances. The Secretary
may waive the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section for a State, for
one fiscal year at a time, if the Secretary determines that—
(1) Granting a waiver would be equitable due to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances such as a natural
disaster or a precipitous and unforeseen decline in the financial resources
of the State; or
(2) The State meets the standard in
§ 300.164 for a waiver of the requirement
to supplement, and not to supplant,
funds received under Part B of the Act.
(d) Subsequent years. If, for any fiscal
year, a State fails to meet the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section,
including any year for which the State
is granted a waiver under paragraph (c)
of this section, the financial support
required of the State in future years

(4) Evidence that the State, in determining that FAPE is currently available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State, has consulted
with the State advisory panel under

the request and supporting evidence
submitted by the State makes a prima

remain, available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State, the
Secretary, after notice to the public
throughout the State, conducts a public hearing at which all interested persons and organizations may present
evidence
regarding
the
following
issues:
(1) Whether FAPE is currently available to all eligible children with disabilities in the State.
(2) Whether the State will be able to
ensure that FAPE remains available to
all eligible children with disabilities in
the State if the Secretary provides the
requested waiver.

§ 300.166

(e) Following the hearing, the Secretary, based on all submitted evidence, will provide a waiver, in whole
or in part, for a period of one year if
the Secretary finds that the State has

that FAPE is currently available to all
eligible children with disabilities in
the State, and the State will be able to
ensure that FAPE remains available to
all eligible children with disabilities in
the State if the Secretary provides the

(f) A State may receive a waiver of
the requirement of section 612(a)(18)(A)
of the Act and § 300.164 if it satisfies the
requirements of paragraphs (b) through

(g) The Secretary may grant subsequent waivers for a period of one year
each, if the Secretary determines that
the State has provided clear and convincing evidence that all eligible children with disabilities throughout the
State have, and will continue to have
throughout the one-year period of the
waiver, FAPE available to them.

Notwithstanding the restriction in
§ 300.203(a), an LEA may reduce the
level of expenditures by the LEA under

just cause, of special education or related services personnel.
(b) A decrease in the enrollment of
children with disabilities.
(c) The termination of the obligation
of the agency, consistent with this
part, to provide a program of special
education to a particular child with a

agency;
(2) Has reached the age at which the
obligation of the agency to provide
FAPE to the child has terminated; or
(3) No longer needs the program of
special education.

(a) General. Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 300.202 and 300.203 or any
other provision of Part B of the Act, an
LEA may use funds received under

paragraph (d) of this section and
§ 300.230(e)(2), for any fiscal year for
which the allocation received by an

the LEA received for the previous fiscal year, the LEA may reduce the level
of expenditures otherwise required by
§ 300.203(a) by not more than 50 percent
of the amount of that excess.
(b) Use of amounts to carry out activities under ESEA. If an LEA exercises
the authority under paragraph (a) of
this section, the LEA must use an
amount of local funds equal to the reduction in expenditures under paragraph (a) of this section to carry out
activities that could be supported with
funds under the ESEA regardless of
whether the LEA is using funds under
the ESEA for those activities.
(c) State prohibition. Notwithstanding

(a) General. If an LEA or a State
agency described in § 300.228 has on file
with the SEA policies and procedures
that demonstrate that the LEA or
State agency meets any requirement of
§ 300.200, including any policies and procedures filed under Part B of the Act as
in effect before December 3, 2004, the
SEA must consider the LEA or State
agency to have met that requirement
for purposes of receiving assistance
under Part B of the Act.
(b) Modification made by an LEA or
State agency. Subject to paragraph (c)
of this section, policies and procedures
submitted by an LEA or a State agency
in accordance with this subpart remain
in effect until the LEA or State agency
submits to the SEA the modifications
that the LEA or State agency determines are necessary.
(c) Modifications required by the SEA.
The SEA may require an LEA or a
State agency to modify its policies and
procedures, but only to the extent necessary to ensure the LEA’s or State

34 CFR Ch. III (7–1–10 Edition)

(1) After December 3, 2004, the effective date of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act
of 2004, the applicable provisions of the
Act (or the regulations developed to
carry out the Act) are amended;
(2) There is a new interpretation of
an applicable provision of the Act by
Federal or State courts; or
(3) There is an official finding of noncompliance with Federal or State law
or regulations.

§ 300.223 Joint establishment of eligibility.
(a) General. An SEA may require an
LEA to establish its eligibility jointly
with another LEA if the SEA determines that the LEA will be ineligible
under this subpart because the agency
will not be able to establish and maintain programs of sufficient size and
scope to effectively meet the needs of
children with disabilities.
(b) Charter school exception. An SEA
may not require a charter school that
is an LEA to jointly establish its eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section unless the charter school is explicitly permitted to do so under the
State’s charter school statute.
(c) Amount of payments. If an SEA requires the joint establishment of eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section, the total amount of funds made
available to the affected LEAs must be
equal to the sum of the payments that
each LEA would have received under
§ 300.705 if the agencies were eligible for
those payments.

Part B of the Act, then the SEA must—
(a) Notify the LEA or State agency of
that determination; and
(b) Provide the LEA or State agency
with reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing.

§ 300.222 LEA and State agency compliance.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1413(e)(1) and (2))

(a) General. If the SEA, after reasonable notice and an opportunity for a
hearing, finds that an LEA or State
agency that has been determined to be
eligible under this subpart is failing to
comply with any requirement described
in §§ 300.201 through 300.213, the SEA
must reduce or must not provide any
further payments to the LEA or State
agency until the SEA is satisfied that
the LEA or State agency is complying
with that requirement.
(b) Notice requirement. Any State
agency or LEA in receipt of a notice
described in paragraph (a) of this section must, by means of public notice,
take the measures necessary to bring
the pendency of an action pursuant to
this section to the attention of the
public within the jurisdiction of the
agency.
(c) Consideration. In carrying out its
responsibilities under this section,
each SEA must consider any decision
resulting from a hearing held under
§§ 300.511 through 300.533 that is adverse
to the LEA or State agency involved in
the decision.

§ 300.226 Early intervening services.
(a) General. An LEA may not use
more than 15 percent of the amount the
LEA receives under Part B of the Act
for any fiscal year, less any amount reduced by the LEA pursuant to § 300.205,
if any, in combination with other
amounts (which may include amounts
other than education funds), to develop
and implement coordinated, early intervening services, which may include
interagency financing structures, for
students in kindergarten through grade
12 (with a particular emphasis on students in kindergarten through grade
three) who are not currently identified
as needing special education or related
services, but who need additional academic and behavioral support to succeed in a general education environment. (See Appendix D for examples of
how § 300.205(d), regarding local maintenance of effort, and § 300.226(a) affect
one another.)
(b) Activities. In implementing coordinated, early intervening services under
this section, an LEA may carry out activities that include—
(1) Professional development (which
may be provided by entities other than
LEAs) for teachers and other school
staff to enable such personnel to deliver scientifically based academic and
behavioral interventions, including scientifically based literacy instruction,
and, where appropriate, instruction on
the use of adaptive and instructional
software; and
(2) Providing educational and behavioral evaluations, services, and supports, including scientifically based literacy instruction.
(c) Construction. Nothing in this section shall be construed to either limit
or create a right to FAPE under Part B
of the Act or to delay appropriate evaluation of a child suspected of having a
disability.

(a) General. (1) An SEA must use the
payments that would otherwise have
been available to an LEA or to a State
agency to provide special education
and related services directly to children with disabilities residing in the
area served by that LEA, or for whom
that State agency is responsible, if the
SEA determines that the LEA or State
agency—
(i) Has not provided the information
needed to establish the eligibility of
the LEA or State agency, or elected
not to apply for its Part B allotment,
under Part B of the Act;
(ii) Is unable to establish and maintain programs of FAPE that meet the
requirements of this part;
(iii) Is unable or unwilling to be consolidated with one or more LEAs in
order to establish and maintain the
programs; or
(iv) Has one or more children with
disabilities who can best be served by a
regional or State program or service
delivery system designed to meet the
needs of these children.

for which the allotment received by a
State under § 300.703 exceeds the
amount the State received for the previous fiscal year and if the State in
school year 2003–2004 or any subsequent
school year pays or reimburses all
LEAs within the State from State revenue 100 percent of the non-Federal
share of the costs of special education
and related services, the SEA, notwithstanding §§ 300.162 through 300.163 (related to State-level nonsupplanting
and maintenance of effort), and § 300.175
(related to direct services by the SEA)
may reduce the level of expenditures
from State sources for the education of
children with disabilities by not more
than 50 percent of the amount of such
excess.
(b) Prohibition. Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the Secretary determines that an SEA is unable to establish, maintain, or oversee
programs of FAPE that meet the requirements of this part, or that the
State needs assistance, intervention, or
substantial intervention under § 300.603,
the Secretary prohibits the SEA from
exercising the authority in paragraph
(a) of this section.
(c) Education activities. If an SEA exercises the authority under paragraph
(a) of this section, the agency must use
funds from State sources, in an amount
equal to the amount of the reduction

support activities authorized under the
ESEA, or to support need-based student or teacher higher education programs.
(d) Report. For each fiscal year for
which an SEA exercises the authority

(a) The State may require that a public agency include in the records of a
child with a disability a statement of
any current or previous disciplinary
action that has been taken against the
child and transmit the statement to
the same extent that the disciplinary
information is included in, and transmitted with, the student records of
nondisabled children.

the child that required disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary
action taken, and any other information that is relevant to the safety of
the child and other individuals involved with the child.

necessary to ensure that all children
with disabilities served by the LEA receive FAPE from the combination of
Federal funds received under Part B of
the Act and State funds received from
the SEA.
(2) If an SEA exercises the authority
under paragraph (a) of this section,
LEAs in the State may not reduce

the reduction in the State funds they
receive.

(ii) The rights of the parents of the
child have been terminated in accordance with State law; or
(iii) The rights of the parent to make
educational decisions have been subrogated by a judge in accordance with

may, but is not required to, pursue the
initial evaluation of the child by utilizing the procedural safeguards in subpart E of this part (including the mediation procedures under § 300.506 or the
due process procedures under §§ 300.507
through 300.516), if appropriate, except
to the extent inconsistent with State
law relating to such parental consent.

§§ 300.301 through 300.311 if it declines to
pursue the evaluation.

public agency that is responsible for
making FAPE available to a child with
a disability must obtain informed consent from the parent of the child before
the initial provision of special education and related services to the child.
(2) The public agency must make reasonable efforts to obtain informed consent from the parent for the initial provision of special education and related
services to the child.
(3) If the parent of a child fails to respond to a request for, or refuses to

§ 300.302 Screening for instructional
purposes is not evaluation.
The screening of a student by a
teacher or specialist to determine appropriate instructional strategies for
curriculum implementation shall not
be considered to be an evaluation for
eligibility for special education and related services.

Initial evaluations.

(a) General. Each public agency must
conduct a full and individual initial
evaluation,
in
accordance
with
§§ 300.304 through 300.306, before the initial provision of special education and
related services to a child with a disability under this part.
(b) Request for initial evaluation. Consistent with the consent requirements
in § 300.300, either a parent of a child or
a public agency may initiate a request
for an initial evaluation to determine
if the child is a child with a disability.
(c) Procedures for initial evaluation.
The initial evaluation—
(1)(i) Must be conducted within 60
days of receiving parental consent for
the evaluation; or
(ii) If the State establishes a timeframe within which the evaluation
must be conducted, within that timeframe; and
(2) Must consist of procedures—
(i) To determine if the child is a child
with a disability under § 300.8; and
(ii) To determine the educational
needs of the child.
(d) Exception. The timeframe described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to a public agency
if—
(1) The parent of a child repeatedly
fails or refuses to produce the child for
the evaluation; or
(2) A child enrolls in a school of another public agency after the relevant
timeframe in paragraph (c)(1) of this
section has begun, and prior to a determination by the child’s previous public
agency as to whether the child is a
child with a disability under § 300.8.
(e) The exception in paragraph (d)(2)
of this section applies only if the subsequent public agency is making sufficient progress to ensure a prompt completion of the evaluation, and the parent and subsequent public agency agree
to a specific time when the evaluation
will be completed.

§ 300.303 Reevaluations.
(a) General. A public agency must ensure that a reevaluation of each child
with a disability is conducted in accordance
with
§§ 300.304
through
300.311—
(1) If the public agency determines
that the educational or related services
needs, including improved academic
achievement and functional performance, of the child warrant a reevaluation; or
(2) If the child’s parent or teacher requests a reevaluation.
(b) Limitation. A reevaluation conducted under paragraph (a) of this section—
(1) May occur not more than once a
year, unless the parent and the public
agency agree otherwise; and
(2) Must occur at least once every 3
years, unless the parent and the public
agency agree that a reevaluation is unnecessary.

agency must—
(1) Use a variety of assessment tools
and strategies to gather relevant functional, developmental, and academic
information about the child, including
information provided by the parent,
that may assist in determining—
(i) Whether the child is a child with
a disability under § 300.8; and
(ii) The content of the child’s IEP, including information related to enabling the child to be involved in and

progress in the general education curriculum (or for a preschool child, to
participate in appropriate activities);
(2) Not use any single measure or assessment as the sole criterion for determining whether a child is a child
with a disability and for determining
an appropriate educational program for
the child; and
(3) Use technically sound instruments that may assess the relative
contribution of cognitive and behavioral factors, in addition to physical or
developmental factors.
(c) Other evaluation procedures. Each
public agency must ensure that—
(1) Assessments and other evaluation
materials used to assess a child under
this part—
(i) Are selected and administered so
as not to be discriminatory on a racial
or cultural basis;
(ii) Are provided and administered in
the child’s native language or other
mode of communication and in the
form most likely to yield accurate information on what the child knows and
can do academically, developmentally,
and functionally, unless it is clearly
not feasible to so provide or administer;
(iii) Are used for the purposes for
which the assessments or measures are
valid and reliable;
(iv) Are administered by trained and
knowledgeable personnel; and
(v) Are administered in accordance
with any instructions provided by the
producer of the assessments.
(2) Assessments and other evaluation
materials include those tailored to assess specific areas of educational need
and not merely those that are designed
to provide a single general intelligence
quotient.
(3) Assessments are selected and administered so as best to ensure that if
an assessment is administered to a
child with impaired sensory, manual,
or speaking skills, the assessment results accurately reflect the child’s aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test purports to
measure, rather than reflecting the
child’s impaired sensory, manual, or
speaking skills (unless those skills are
the factors that the test purports to
measure).

(4) The child is assessed in all areas
related to the suspected disability, including, if appropriate, health, vision,
hearing, social and emotional status,
general intelligence, academic performance, communicative status, and
motor abilities;
(5) Assessments of children with disabilities who transfer from one public
agency to another public agency in the
same school year are coordinated with
those children’s prior and subsequent
schools, as necessary and as expeditiously as possible, consistent with
§ 300.301(d)(2) and (e), to ensure prompt
completion of full evaluations.
(6) In evaluating each child with a
disability under §§ 300.304 through
300.306, the evaluation is sufficiently
comprehensive to identify all of the
child’s special education and related
services needs, whether or not commonly linked to the disability category
in which the child has been classified.
(7) Assessment tools and strategies
that provide relevant information that
directly assists persons in determining
the educational needs of the child are
provided.

(ii) The present levels of academic
achievement and related developmental needs of the child;
(iii)(A) Whether the child needs special education and related services; or
(B) In the case of a reevaluation of a
child, whether the child continues to
need special education and related
services; and
(iv) Whether any additions or modifications to the special education and
related services are needed to enable
the child to meet the measurable annual goals set out in the IEP of the
child and to participate, as appropriate, in the general education curriculum.
(b) Conduct of review. The group described in paragraph (a) of this section
may conduct its review without a
meeting.
(c) Source of data. The public agency
must administer such assessments and
other evaluation measures as may be
needed to produce the data identified
under paragraph (a) of this section.
(d) Requirements if additional data are
not needed. (1) If the IEP Team and
other qualified professionals, as appropriate, determine that no additional
data are needed to determine whether
the child continues to be a child with a
disability, and to determine the child’s
educational needs, the public agency
must notify the child’s parents of—
(i) That determination and the reasons for the determination; and
(ii) The right of the parents to request an assessment to determine
whether the child continues to be a
child with a disability, and to determine the child’s educational needs.
(2) The public agency is not required
to conduct the assessment described in
paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section unless requested to do so by the child’s
parents.
(e) Evaluations before change in eligibility. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a public
agency must evaluate a child with a
disability in accordance with §§ 300.304
through 300.311 before determining that
the child is no longer a child with a
disability.
(2) The evaluation described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not re-

§ 300.306

quired before the termination of a
child’s eligibility under this part due
to graduation from secondary school
with a regular diploma, or due to exceeding the age eligibility for FAPE
under State law.
(3) For a child whose eligibility terminates under circumstances described
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, a
public agency must provide the child
with a summary of the child’s academic achievement and functional performance, which shall include recommendations on how to assist the
child in meeting the child’s postsecondary goals.

and the educational needs of the child;
and
(2) The public agency provides a copy
of the evaluation report and the documentation of determination of eligibility at no cost to the parent.
(b) Special rule for eligibility determination. A child must not be determined to
be a child with a disability under this
part—
(1) If the determinant factor for that
determination is—
(i) Lack of appropriate instruction in
reading, including the essential components of reading instruction (as defined
in section 1208(3) of the ESEA);
(ii) Lack of appropriate instruction
in math; or
(iii) Limited English proficiency; and

may serve as the IEP of the child, if
using the IFSP as the IEP is—
(i) Consistent with State policy; and
(ii) Agreed to by the agency and the
child’s parents.
(2) In implementing the requirements
of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the

pursuant to 34 CFR 99.31(a)(2); and
(2) The previous public agency in
which the child was enrolled must take
reasonable steps to promptly respond
to the request from the new public
agency.

(iv) The academic, developmental,
and functional needs of the child.
(2) Consideration of special factors. The
IEP Team must—
(i) In the case of a child whose behavior impedes the child’s learning or that
of others, consider the use of positive
behavioral interventions and supports,
and other strategies, to address that
behavior;
(ii) In the case of a child with limited
English proficiency, consider the language needs of the child as those needs
relate to the child’s IEP;
(iii) In the case of a child who is blind
or visually impaired, provide for instruction in Braille and the use of
Braille unless the IEP Team determines, after an evaluation of the
child’s reading and writing skills,
needs, and appropriate reading and
writing media (including an evaluation
of the child’s future needs for instruction in Braille or the use of Braille),
that instruction in Braille or the use of
Braille is not appropriate for the child;
(iv) Consider the communication
needs of the child, and in the case of a
child who is deaf or hard of hearing,
consider the child’s language and communication needs, opportunities for direct communications with peers and

§ 300.324

(c) Failure to meet transition objectives—(1) Participating agency failure. If
a participating agency, other than the
public agency, fails to provide the transition services described in the IEP in
accordance with § 300.320(b), the public
agency must reconvene the IEP Team
to identify alternative strategies to
meet the transition objectives for the
child set out in the IEP.
(2) Construction. Nothing in this part
relieves any participating agency, including a State vocational rehabilitation agency, of the responsibility to
provide or pay for any transition service that the agency would otherwise
provide to children with disabilities
who meet the eligibility criteria of
that agency.
(d) Children with disabilities in adult
prisons—(1) Requirements that do not
apply. The following requirements do
not apply to children with disabilities
who are convicted as adults under
State law and incarcerated in adult
prisons:
(i) The requirements contained in
section 612(a)(16) of the Act and
§ 300.320(a)(6) (relating to participation
of children with disabilities in general
assessments).
(ii) The requirements in § 300.320(b)
(relating to transition planning and
transition services) do not apply with
respect to the children whose eligibility under Part B of the Act will end,
because of their age, before they will be
eligible to be released from prison
based on consideration of their sentence and eligibility for early release.
(2) Modifications of IEP or placement.
(i) Subject to paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of
this section, the IEP Team of a child
with a disability who is convicted as an
adult under State law and incarcerated
in an adult prison may modify the
child’s IEP or placement if the State
has demonstrated a bona fide security
or compelling penological interest that
cannot otherwise be accommodated.
(ii) The requirements of §§ 300.320 (relating to IEPs), and 300.112 (relating to
LRE), do not apply with respect to the
modifications described in paragraph
(d)(2)(i) of this section.

the public agency may agree not to
convene an IEP Team meeting for the
purposes of making those changes, and
instead may develop a written document to amend or modify the child’s
current IEP.
(ii) If changes are made to the child’s
IEP in accordance with paragraph
(a)(4)(i) of this section, the public agency must ensure that the child’s IEP
Team is informed of those changes.
(5) Consolidation of IEP Team meetings.
To the extent possible, the public agency must encourage the consolidation of
reevaluation meetings for the child and
other IEP Team meetings for the child.
(6) Amendments. Changes to the IEP
may be made either by the entire IEP
Team at an IEP Team meeting, or as
provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, by amending the IEP rather than
by redrafting the entire IEP. Upon request, a parent must be provided with
a revised copy of the IEP with the
amendments incorporated.
(b) Review and revision of IEPs—(1)
General. Each public agency must ensure that, subject to paragraphs (b)(2)
and (b)(3) of this section, the IEP
Team—
(i) Reviews the child’s IEP periodically, but not less than annually, to determine whether the annual goals for
the child are being achieved; and
(ii) Revises the IEP, as appropriate,
to address—
(A) Any lack of expected progress toward the annual goals described in
§ 300.320(a)(2), and in the general education curriculum, if appropriate;
(B) The results of any reevaluation
conducted under § 300.303;
(C) Information about the child provided to, or by, the parents, as described under § 300.305(a)(2);
(D) The child’s anticipated needs; or
(E) Other matters.
(2) Consideration of special factors. In
conducting a review of the child’s IEP,
the IEP Team must consider the special factors described in paragraph
(a)(2) of this section.
(3) Requirement with respect to regular
education teacher. A regular education
teacher of the child, as a member of
the IEP Team, must, consistent with
paragraph (a)(3) of this section, participate in the review and revision of the
IEP of the child.

§ 300.325 Private school placements by
public agencies.
(a) Developing IEPs. (1) Before a public agency places a child with a disability in, or refers a child to, a private
school or facility, the agency must initiate and conduct a meeting to develop
an IEP for the child in accordance with
§§ 300.320 and 300.324.
(2) The agency must ensure that a
representative of the private school or
facility attends the meeting. If the representative cannot attend, the agency

private school or facility at the discretion of the public agency.
(2) If the private school or facility
initiates and conducts these meetings,
the public agency must ensure that the
parents and an agency representative—
(i) Are involved in any decision about
the child’s IEP; and

cost of the evaluation or ensures that
the evaluation is otherwise provided at
no cost to the parent, consistent with

expense. (1) A parent has the right to an
independent educational evaluation at
public expense if the parent disagrees
with an evaluation obtained by the
public agency, subject to the conditions in paragraphs (b)(2) through (4) of
this section.
(2) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation at public expense, the public agency must,
without unnecessary delay, either—
(i) File a due process complaint to request a hearing to show that its evaluation is appropriate; or
(ii) Ensure that an independent educational evaluation is provided at public expense, unless the agency demonstrates in a hearing pursuant to
§§ 300.507 through 300.513 that the evaluation obtained by the parent did not
meet agency criteria.
(3) If the public agency files a due
process complaint notice to request a
hearing and the final decision is that
the agency’s evaluation is appropriate,
the parent still has the right to an
independent educational evaluation,
but not at public expense.
(4) If a parent requests an independent educational evaluation, the
public agency may ask for the parent’s
reason why he or she objects to the
public evaluation. However, the public
agency may not require the parent to
provide an explanation and may not
unreasonably delay either providing
the independent educational evaluation at public expense or filing a due
process complaint to request a due
process hearing to defend the public
evaluation.
(5) A parent is entitled to only one
independent educational evaluation at
public expense each time the public
agency conducts an evaluation with
which the parent disagrees.

disability is a member of any group
that makes decisions on the educational placement of the parent’s
child.
(2) In implementing the requirements
of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the
public agency must use procedures consistent with the procedures described
in § 300.322(a) through (b)(1).

this section, the failure of the parent
filing a due process complaint to participate in the resolution meeting will
delay the timelines for the resolution
process and due process hearing until

dismiss the parent’s due process complaint.
(5) If the LEA fails to hold the resolution meeting specified in paragraph (a)

complaint or fails to participate in the
resolution meeting, the parent may
seek the intervention of a hearing officer to begin the due process hearing

protected when—
(1) No parent (as defined in § 300.30)
can be identified;
(2) The public agency, after reasonable efforts, cannot locate a parent;
(3) The child is a ward of the State
under the laws of that State; or
(4) The child is an unaccompanied
homeless youth as defined in section
725(6) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless
Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(6)).
(b) Duties of public agency. The duties
of a public agency under paragraph (a)
of this section include the assignment
of an individual to act as a surrogate
for the parents. This must include a
method—
(1) For determining whether a child
needs a surrogate parent; and
(2) For assigning a surrogate parent
to the child.
(c) Wards of the State. In the case of a
child who is a ward of the State, the

(a) Except as provided in § 300.533,
during the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding regarding a
due process complaint notice requesting a due process hearing under
§ 300.507, unless the State or local agency and the parents of the child agree
otherwise, the child involved in the
complaint must remain in his or her
current educational placement.
(b) If the complaint involves an application for initial admission to public
school, the child, with the consent of
the parents, must be placed in the public school until the completion of all
the proceedings.
(c) If the complaint involves an application for initial services under this
part from a child who is transitioning
from Part C of the Act to Part B and is
no longer eligible for Part C services
because the child has turned three, the
public agency is not required to provide the Part C services that the child
had been receiving. If the child is found
eligible for special education and related services under Part B and the
parent consents to the initial provision
of special education and related services under § 300.300(b), then the public
agency must provide those special education and related services that are not
in dispute between the parent and the
public agency.

process hearing conducted by the SEA
or a State review official in an administrative appeal agrees with the child’s
parents that a change of placement is

(to the extent those alternatives are
applied to children without disabilities), and for additional removals of
not more than 10 consecutive school
days in that same school year for separate incidents of misconduct (as long
as those removals do not constitute a
change of placement under § 300.536).
(2) After a child with a disability has
been removed from his or her current
placement for 10 school days in the
same school year, during any subsequent days of removal the public agency must provide services to the extent
required under paragraph (d) of this

§ 300.530

(e) Manifestation determination. (1)
Within 10 school days of any decision
to change the placement of a child with
a disability because of a violation of a
code of student conduct, the LEA, the
parent, and relevant members of the
child’s IEP Team (as determined by the
parent and the LEA) must review all
relevant information in the student’s
file, including the child’s IEP, any
teacher observations, and any relevant
information provided by the parents to
determine—
(i) If the conduct in question was
caused by, or had a direct and substantial relationship to, the child’s disability; or
(ii) If the conduct in question was the
direct result of the LEA’s failure to implement the IEP.
(2) The conduct must be determined
to be a manifestation of the child’s disability if the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the child’s IEP Team
determine that a condition in either
paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this section was met.
(3) If the LEA, the parent, and relevant members of the child’s IEP Team
determine the condition described in
paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section was
met, the LEA must take immediate
steps to remedy those deficiencies.
(f) Determination that behavior was a
manifestation. If the LEA, the parent,
and relevant members of the IEP Team
make the determination that the conduct was a manifestation of the child’s
disability, the IEP Team must—
(1) Either—
(i) Conduct a functional behavioral
assessment, unless the LEA had conducted a functional behavioral assessment before the behavior that resulted
in the change of placement occurred,
and implement a behavioral intervention plan for the child; or
(ii) If a behavioral intervention plan
already has been developed, review the
behavioral intervention plan, and modify it, as necessary, to address the behavior; and
(2) Except as provided in paragraph
(g) of this section, return the child to
the placement from which the child
was removed, unless the parent and the
LEA agree to a change of placement as
part of the modification of the behavioral intervention plan.

this section, school personnel may
apply the relevant disciplinary procedures to children with disabilities in
the same manner and for the same duration as the procedures would be applied to children without disabilities,
except as provided in paragraph (d) of
this section.
(d) Services. (1) A child with a disability who is removed from the child’s
current placement pursuant to paragraphs (c), or (g) of this section must—
(i) Continue to receive educational
services, as provided in § 300.101(a), so
as to enable the child to continue to
participate in the general education
curriculum, although in another setting, and to progress toward meeting
the goals set out in the child’s IEP; and
(ii) Receive, as appropriate, a functional behavioral assessment, and behavioral intervention services and
modifications, that are designed to address the behavior violation so that it
does not recur.
(2) The services required by paragraph (d)(1), (d)(3), (d)(4), and (d)(5) of
this section may be provided in an interim alternative educational setting.
(3) A public agency is only required
to provide services during periods of removal to a child with a disability who
has been removed from his or her current placement for 10 school days or
less in that school year, if it provides
services to a child without disabilities
who is similarly removed.
(4) After a child with a disability has
been removed from his or her current
placement for 10 school days in the
same school year, if the current removal is for not more than 10 consecutive school days and is not a change of
placement under § 300.536, school personnel, in consultation with at least
one of the child’s teachers, determine
the extent to which services are needed, as provided in § 300.101(a), so as to
enable the child to continue to participate in the general education curriculum, although in another setting,
and to progress toward meeting the
goals set out in the child’s IEP.
(5) If the removal is a change of
placement under § 300.536, the child’s
IEP Team determines appropriate services under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

public agency had knowledge (as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)
of this section) that the child was a
child with a disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action occurred.
(b) Basis of knowledge. A public agency must be deemed to have knowledge
that a child is a child with a disability

subjected to the disciplinary measures
applied to children without disabilities

consistent with paragraph (d)(2) of this
section.
(2)(i) If a request is made for an evaluation of a child during the time period
in which the child is subjected to disciplinary measures under § 300.530, the
evaluation must be conducted in an expedited manner.
(ii) Until the evaluation is completed, the child remains in the educational placement determined by
school authorities, which can include
suspension or expulsion without educational services.
(iii) If the child is determined to be a
child with a disability, taking into consideration information from the evaluation conducted by the agency and information provided by the parents, the
agency must provide special education
and related services in accordance with
this part, including the requirements
of §§ 300.530 through 300.536 and section

§ 300.536 Change of placement because
of disciplinary removals.
(a) For purposes of removals of a
child with a disability from the child’s
current educational placement under
§§ 300.530 through 300.535, a change of
placement occurs if—
(1) The removal is for more than 10
consecutive school days; or
(2) The child has been subjected to a
series of removals that constitute a
pattern—
(i) Because the series of removals
total more than 10 school days in a
school year;
(ii) Because the child’s behavior is
substantially similar to the child’s behavior in previous incidents that resulted in the series of removals; and
(iii) Because of such additional factors as the length of each removal, the
total amount of time the child has
been removed, and the proximity of the
removals to one another.
(b)(1) The public agency determines
on a case-by-case basis whether a pattern of removals constitutes a change
of placement.
(2) This determination is subject to
review through due process and judicial
proceedings.

(a) Rule of construction. Nothing in
this part prohibits an agency from reporting a crime committed by a child
with a disability to appropriate authorities or prevents State law enforcement and judicial authorities from exercising their responsibilities with regard to the application of Federal and
State law to crimes committed by a
child with a disability.
(b) Transmittal of records. (1) An agency reporting a crime committed by a
child with a disability must ensure
that copies of the special education and
disciplinary records of the child are
transmitted for consideration by the
appropriate authorities to whom the
agency reports the crime.
(2) An agency reporting a crime
under this section may transmit copies

§ 300.703

for payments to the outlying areas, the
freely associated States, and the Secretary of the Interior under § 300.701 (a)

the States in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.
(b) Special rule for use of fiscal year
1999 amount. If a State received any
funds under section 611 of the Act for
fiscal year 1999 on the basis of children
aged three through five, but does not
make FAPE available to all children
with disabilities aged three through
five in the State in any subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary computes the
State’s amount for fiscal year 1999,
solely for the purpose of calculating
the State’s allocation in that subsequent year under paragraph (c) or (d) of
this section, by subtracting the
amount allocated to the State for fiscal year 1999 on the basis of those children.
(c) Increase in funds. If the amount
available for allocations to States
under paragraph (a) of this section for
a fiscal year is equal to or greater than
the amount allocated to the States
under section 611 of the Act for the preceding fiscal year, those allocations
are calculated as follows:
(1) Allocation of increase—(i) General.
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)
of this section, the Secretary allocates
for the fiscal year—
(A) To each State the amount the
State received under this section for

(B) Eighty-five (85) percent of any remaining funds to States on the basis of
the States’ relative populations of children aged 3 through 21 who are of the
same age as children with disabilities
for whom the State ensures the availability of FAPE under Part B of the
Act; and
(C) Fifteen (15) percent of those remaining funds to States on the basis of
the States’ relative populations of children described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)
of this section who are living in poverty.
(ii) Data. For the purpose of making
grants under this section, the Secretary uses the most recent population
data, including data on children living
in poverty, that are available and satisfactory to the Secretary.

neutral cost sharing and reimbursement program of high need, low incidence, catastrophic, or extraordinary
aid to LEAs that provides services to
high need children based on eligibility
criteria for such programs that were

(9) Funds reserved under paragraph
(c)(1)(i) of this section from the appropriation for any fiscal year, but not expended pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of
this section before the beginning of
their last year of availability for obligation, must be allocated to LEAs in

§ 300.705 Subgrants to LEAs.
(a) Subgrants required. Each State
that receives a grant under section 611
of the Act for any fiscal year must dis-

tribute any funds the State does not
reserve under § 300.704 to LEAs (including public charter schools that operate
as LEAs) in the State that have established their eligibility under section
613 of the Act for use in accordance
with Part B of the Act. Effective with
funds that become available on the
July 1, 2009, each State must distribute
funds to eligible LEAs, including public charter schools that operate as
LEAs, even if the LEA is not serving
any children with disabilities.
(b) Allocations to LEAs. For each fiscal year for which funds are allocated
to States under § 300.703, each State
shall allocate funds as follows:
(1) Base payments. The State first
must award each LEA described in
paragraph (a) of this section the
amount the LEA would have received
under section 611 of the Act for fiscal
year 1999, if the State had distributed
75 percent of its grant for that year
under section 611(d) of the Act, as that
section was then in effect.
(2) Base payment adjustments. For any
fiscal year after 1999—
(i) If a new LEA is created, the State
must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this
section for the LEAs that would have
been responsible for serving children
with disabilities now being served by
the new LEA, among the new LEA and
affected LEAs based on the relative
numbers of children with disabilities
ages 3 through 21, or ages 6 through 21
if a State has had its payment reduced
under § 300.703(b), currently provided
special education by each of the LEAs;
(ii) If one or more LEAs are combined
into a single new LEA, the State must
combine the base allocations of the
merged LEAs;
(iii) If, for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative
responsibility for providing services to
children with disabilities ages 3
through 21 change, the base allocations
of affected LEAs must be redistributed
among affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 21, or ages 6
through 21 if a State has had its payment reduced under § 300.703(b), currently provided special education by
each affected LEA; and

(iv) If an LEA received a base payment of zero in its first year of operation, the SEA must adjust the base
payment for the first fiscal year after
the first annual child count in which
the LEA reports that it is serving any
children with disabilities. The State
must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this
section for the LEAs that would have
been responsible for serving children
with disabilities now being served by
the LEA, among the LEA and affected
LEAs based on the relative numbers of
children with disabilities ages 3
through 21, or ages 6 through 21 currently provided special education by
each of the LEAs. This requirement
takes effect with funds that become
available on July 1, 2009.
(3) Allocation of remaining funds. After
making allocations under paragraph
(b)(1) of this section, as adjusted by
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the
State must—
(i) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those LEAs on the basis of
the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary
schools and secondary schools within
the LEA’s jurisdiction; and
(ii) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those LEAs in accordance with their relative numbers of
children living in poverty, as determined by the SEA.
(c) Reallocation of LEA funds. (1) If an
SEA determines that an LEA is adequately providing FAPE to all children
with disabilities residing in the area
served by that agency with State and
local funds, the SEA may reallocate
any portion of the funds under this
part that are not needed by that LEA
to provide FAPE, to other LEAs in the
State that are not adequately providing special education and related
services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by
those other LEAs. The SEA may also
retain those funds for use at the State
level to the extent the State has not
reserved the maximum amount of
funds it is permitted to reserve for
State-level activities pursuant to
§ 300.704.
(2) After an SEA distributes funds
under this part to an eligible LEA that
is not serving any children with dis-

§ 300.707

abilities, as provided in paragraph (a)
of this section, the SEA must determine, within a reasonable period of
time prior to the end of the carryover
period in 34 CFR 76.709, whether the
LEA has obligated the funds. The SEA
may reallocate any of those funds not
obligated by the LEA to other LEAs in
the State that are not adequately providing special education and related
services to all children with disabilities residing in the areas served by
those other LEAs. The SEA may also
retain those funds for use at the State
level to the extent the State has not
reserved the maximum amount of
funds it is permitted to reserve for
State-level activities pursuant to
§ 300.704.

§ 300.816 Allocations to LEAs.
(a) Base payments. The State must
first award each LEA described in
§ 300.815 the amount that agency would
have received under section 619 of the
Act for fiscal year 1997 if the State had
distributed 75 percent of its grant for
that year under section 619(c)(3), as
such section was then in effect.
(b) Base payment adjustments. For fiscal year 1998 and beyond—

(1) If a new LEA is created, the State
must divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (a) of this section for the LEAs that would have been
responsible for serving children with
disabilities now being served by the
new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages
three through five currently provided
special education by each of the LEAs;
(2) If one or more LEAs are combined
into a single new LEA, the State must
combine the base allocations of the
merged LEAs;
(3) If for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative
responsibility for providing services to
children with disabilities ages three
through five changes, the base allocations of affected LEAs must be redistributed among affected LEAs based on
the relative numbers of children with
disabilities ages three through five currently provided special education by
each affected LEA; and
(4) If an LEA received a base payment of zero in its first year of operation, the SEA must adjust the base
payment for the first fiscal year after
the first annual child count in which
the LEA reports that it is serving any
children with disabilities aged three
through five years. The State must divide the base allocation determined
under paragraph (a) of this section for
the LEAs that would have been responsible for serving children with disabilities aged three through five years now
being served by the LEA, among the
LEA and affected LEAs based on the
relative numbers of children with disabilities aged three through five years
currently provided special education
by each of the LEAs. This requirement
takes effect with funds that become
available on July 1, 2009.
(c) Allocation of remaining funds. After
making allocations under paragraph (a)
of this section, the State must—
(1) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those LEAs on the basis of
the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary
schools and secondary schools within
the LEA’s jurisdiction; and

Reallocation of LEA funds.

(a) If an SEA determines that an
LEA is adequately providing FAPE to
all children with disabilities aged three
through five years residing in the area
served by the LEA with State and local
funds, the SEA may reallocate any portion of the funds under section 619 of

LEA to provide FAPE, to other LEAs
in the State that are not adequately
providing special education and related
services to all children with disabilities aged three through five years residing in the areas served by those
other LEAs. The SEA may also retain
those funds for use at the State level to
the extent the State has not reserved
the maximum amount of funds it is
permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to § 300.812.

serving any children with disabilities
aged three through five years, as provided in § 300.815, the SEA must determine, within a reasonable period of
time prior to the end of the carryover
period in 34 CFR 76.709, whether the
LEA has obligated the funds. The SEA
may reallocate any of those funds not
obligated by the LEA to other LEAs in
the State that are not adequately providing special education and related
services to all children with disabilities aged three through five years residing in the areas served by those
other LEAs. The SEA may also retain
those funds for use at the State level to
the extent the State has not reserved
the maximum amount of funds it is

Pt. 300, App. A

permitted to reserve for State-level activities pursuant to § 300.812.

§ 300.818 Part C of the Act inapplicable.
Part C of the Act does not apply to

the Act, with funds received under section 619 of the Act.
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(h))

APPENDIX A TO PART 300—EXCESS COSTS
CALCULATION
Except as otherwise provided, amounts
provided to an LEA under Part B of the Act
may be used only to pay the excess costs of
providing special education and related services to children with disabilities. Excess
costs are those costs for the education of an
elementary school or secondary school student with a disability that are in excess of
the average annual per student expenditure
in an LEA during the preceding school year
for an elementary school or secondary school
student, as may be appropriate. An LEA
must spend at least the average annual per
student expenditure on the education of an
elementary school or secondary school child
with a disability before funds under Part B
of the Act are used to pay the excess costs of
providing special education and related services.
Section 602(8) of the Act and § 300.16 require
the LEA to compute the minimum average
amount separately for children with disabilities in its elementary schools and for children with disabilities in its secondary
schools. LEAs may not compute the minimum average amount it must spend on the
education of children with disabilities based
on a combination of the enrollments in its
elementary schools and secondary schools.
The following example shows how to compute the minimum average amount an LEA
must spend for the education of each of its
elementary school children with disabilities
under section 602(3) of the Act before it may
use funds under Part B of the Act.
a. First the LEA must determine the total
amount of its expenditures for elementary
school students from all sources—local,
State, and Federal (including Part B)—in the
preceding school year. Only capital outlay
and debt services are excluded.
Example: The following is an example of a
computation for children with disabilities
enrolled in an LEA’s elementary schools. In
this example, the LEA had an average elementary school enrollment for the preceding
school year of 800 (including 100 children

c. Except as otherwise provided, the LEA
next must determine the average annual per
student expenditure for its elementary
schools dividing the average number of students enrolled in the elementary schools of
the agency during the preceding year (including its children with disabilities) into
the amount computed under the above paragraph. The amount obtained through this
computation is the minimum amount the
LEA must spend (on the average) for the
education of each of its elementary school
children with disabilities. Funds under Part
B of the Act may be used only for costs over
and above this minimum.

(1) A proportionate share of the LEA’s
subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act for
children with disabilities aged 3 through 21.
This is an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA’s total subgrant under section 611(f) of the Act as the number of parentally-placed private school children with disabilities aged 3 through 21 enrolled in private
elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA is to the total number of
children with disabilities enrolled in public
and private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA aged 3
through 21; and
(2) A proportionate share of the LEA’s
subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act for
children with disabilities aged 3 through 5.
This is an amount that is the same proportion of the LEA’s total subgrant under section 619(g) of the Act as the total number of
parentally-placed private school children
with disabilities aged 3 through 5 enrolled in
private elementary schools located in the
LEA is to the total number of children with
disabilities enrolled in public and private elementary schools located in the LEA aged 3
through 5.
Consistent with section 612(a)(10)(A)(i) of
the Act and § 300.133 of these regulations, annual expenditures for parentally-placed private school children with disabilities are calculated based on the total number of children with disabilities enrolled in public and
private elementary schools and secondary
schools located in the LEA eligible to receive special education and related services
under Part B, as compared with the total
number of eligible parentally-placed private
school children with disabilities enrolled in
private elementary schools located in the
LEA. This ratio is used to determine the proportion of the LEA’s total Part B subgrants
under section 611(f) of the Act for children
aged 3 through 21, and under section 619(g) of
the Act for children aged 3 through 5, that is
to be expended on services for parentallyplaced private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools
and secondary schools located in the LEA.
The following is an example of how the
proportionate share is calculated:
There are 300 eligible children with disabilities enrolled in the Flintstone School District and 20 eligible parentally-placed private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools and secondary schools located in the LEA for a total
of 320 eligible public and private school children with disabilities (note: proportionate
share for parentally-placed private school
children is based on total children eligible,
not children served). The number of eligible
parentally-placed private school children
with disabilities (20) divided by the total
number of eligible public and private school
children with disabilities (320) indicates that
6.25 percent of the LEA’s subgrant must be

Pt. 300, App. C

spent for the group of eligible parentallyplaced children with disabilities enrolled in
private elementary schools and secondary
schools located in the LEA. Flintstone
School District receives $152,500 in Federal
flow through funds. Therefore, the LEA must
spend $9,531.25 on special education or related services to the group of parentallyplaced private school children with disabilities enrolled in private elementary schools
and secondary schools located in the LEA.
(Note: The LEA must calculate the proportionate share of IDEA funds before earmarking funds for any early intervening activities in § 300.226).
The following outlines the calculations for
the example of how the proportionate share
is calculated.

NIMAS. Under section 674(e)(4) of the Act,
the NIMAS applies to print instructional
materials published after July 19, 2006. The
purpose of the NIMAS is to help increase the
availability and timely delivery of print instructional materials in accessible formats
to blind or other persons with print disabilities in elementary and secondary schools.
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS—THE BASELINE
ELEMENT SET
The Baseline Element Set details the minimum requirement that must be delivered to
fulfill the NIMAS. It is the responsibility of
publishers
to
provide
this
NIMASconformant XML content file, a package file
(OPF), a PDF-format copy of the title page
(or whichever page(s) contain(s) ISBN and
copyright information), and a full set of the
content’s images. All of the images included
within a work must be provided in a folder
and placeholders entered in the relevant
XML document indicating their location (all
images must be included). The preferred
image type is SVG, next is either PNG or
JPG format. Images should be rendered in

the same size/proportion as their originals at
300 dpi. Images should be named with relative path filenames in XML files (example:
img id=‘‘staricon4’’ src=‘‘./images/U10C02/
staricon4.jpg’’ alt=‘‘star icon’’).
NIMAS-conformant content must be valid
to the NIMAS 1.1 [see ANSI/NISO Z39.86 2005
or subsequent revisions]. In addition, files
are required to use the tags from the Baseline Element Set when such tags are appropriate. Publishers are encouraged to augment the required Baseline Element Set
with tags from the Optional Element Set
(elements not included in the Standard) as
applicable. For the purposes of NIMAS, appropriate usage of elements, both baseline
and optional, is defined by the DAISY Structure Guidelines. Files that do not follow
these guidelines in the selection and application of tags are not conformant to this
Standard. Both optional elements and appropriate structure guidelines may be located
within Z39.86–2002 and Z39.86–2005 available
from http://www.daisy.org/z3986/. Use of the
most current standard is recommended.

1. THE OPTIONAL ELEMENTS AND GUIDELINES
FOR USE

WReier-Aviles on DSKGBLS3C1PROD with CFR

Publishers are encouraged to apply markup beyond the baseline (required) elements.
The complete DTBook Element Set reflects
the tags necessary to create the six types of
Digital Talking Books and Braille output.
Because of the present necessity to subdivide
the creation of alternate format materials
into distinct phases, the Panel determined
that baseline elements would be provided by
publishers, and optional elements would be
added to the NIMAS-conformant files by
third party conversion entities. In both circumstances the protocols for tagging digital
files should conform to the most current
ANSI/NISO Z39.86 specification. Content converters are directed to the most current
DAISY
Structure
Guidelines
(http://
www.daisy.org/z3986/) for guidance on their
use.
Since the publication of the original National File Format report from which the
NIMAS technical specifications were derived, ANSI/NISO Z39.86–2002 was updated
and is now ANSI/NISO Z39.86–2005. It may be
best to avoid using the following optional
elements which are no longer included in
ANSI/NISO Z39.86–2005: style, notice, hr, and
levelhd.
Also, the following new elements were introduced by ANSI/NISO Z39.86–2005 and
should be considered optional elements for
the NIMAS: bridgehead, byline, covertitle,
dateline, epigraph, linegroup, and poem.
Please refer to ANSI/NISO Z39.86–2005 for additional information regarding these elements. To access the ANSI/NISO Z39.86–2005
specification, go to http://www.daisy.org/z3986/
.
2. PACKAGE FILE
A package file describes a publication. It
identifies all other files in the publication
and provides descriptive and access information about them. A publication must include

a package file conforming to the NIMAS.
The package file is based on the Open eBook
Publication Structure 1.2 package file specification (For most recent detail please see
http://www.openebook.org/oebps/oebps1.2/
download/oeb12-xhtml.htm#sec2). A NIMAS
package file must be an XML-valid OeB PS
1.2 package file instance and must meet the
following additional standards:
The NIMAS Package File must include the
following Dublin Core (dc:)metadata:
dc:Title.
dc:Creator (if applicable).
dc:Publisher.
dc:Date (Date of NIMAS-compliant file creation—yyyy-mm-dd).
dc:Format (=‘‘NIMAS 1.0’’).
dc:Identifier (a unique identifier for the
NIMAS-compliant digital publication, e.g.,
print ISBN + ‘‘-NIMAS’’—exact format to
be determined).
dc:Language (one instance, or multiple in
the case of a foreign language textbook,
etc.).
dc:Rights (details to be determined).
dc:Source (ISBN of print version of textbook).
And the following x-metadata items:
nimas-SourceEdition (the edition of the
print textbook).
nimas-SourceDate (date of publication of the
print textbook).
The following metadata were proposed also
as a means of facilitating recordkeeping,
storage and file retrieval:
dc:Subject (Lang Arts, Soc Studies, etc.).
nimas-grade (specific grade level of the print
textbook, e.g.; Grade 6).
nimas gradeRange (specific grade range of
the print textbook, e.g.; Grades 4–5).
An additional suggestion references the
use of:
dc:audience:educationLevel (for the grade
and gradeRange identifiers, noting that
Dublin
Core

one grade would therefore have two elements, one with value ‘‘Grade 4’’ and another with value ‘‘Grade 5.’’
A final determination as to which of these
specific metadata elements to use needs to
be clarified in practice. The package manifest must list all provided files (text, images,
etc.).
(NOTE: For purposes of continuity and to
minimize errors in transformation and processing, the NIMAS-compliant digital text
should be provided as a single document.)
3. MODULAR EXTENSIONS
The most current DAISY/NISO standard,
formally the ANSI/NISO Z39.86, Specifications
for the Digital Talking Book defines a comprehensive system for creating Digital Talking Books. A part of this standard is
DTBook, an XML vocabulary that provides a
core set of elements needed to produce most
types of books. However, DTBook is not intended to be an exhaustive vocabulary for all
types of books.
Guidelines for the correct approach to extend the DAISY/NISO standard have been established. Mathematics, video support, testing, workbooks, music, dictionaries, chemistry, and searching are some of the extensions that have been discussed. Visit http://
www.daisy.org/z3986/ to learn more about
modular extensions.

APPENDIX D TO PART 300—MAINTENANCE
OF EFFORT AND EARLY INTERVENING
SERVICES
LEAs that seek to reduce their local maintenance of effort in accordance with
§ 300.205(d) and use some of their Part B funds
for early intervening services under § 300.226
must do so with caution because the local
maintenance of effort reduction provision
and the authority to use Part B funds for
early
intervening
services
are
interconnected. The decisions that an LEA makes
about the amount of funds that it uses for
one purpose affect the amount that it may
use for the other. Below are examples that illustrate how §§ 300.205(d) and 300.226(a) affect
one another.
Example 1: In this example, the amount
that is 15 percent of the LEA’s total grant
(see § 300.226(a)), which is the maximum
amount that the LEA may use for early intervening services (EIS), is greater than the

Pt. 300, App. D

amount that may be used for local maintenance of effort (MOE) reduction (50 percent
of the increase in the LEA’s grant from the
prior year’s grant) (see § 300.205(a)).
Prior Year’s Allocation ............
Current Year’s Allocation ........
Increase ....................................
Maximum Available for MOE
Reduction ..............................

50,000.
150,000.

If the LEA chooses to set aside $150,000 for
EIS, it may not reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $150,000 for EIS means $0
can be used for MOE).
If the LEA chooses to set aside $100,000 for
EIS, it may not reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $100,000 for EIS means $0
can be used for MOE).
If the LEA chooses to set aside $50,000 for
EIS, it may not reduce its MOE (MOE maximum $50,000 less $50,000 for EIS means $0 can
be used for MOE).
If the LEA chooses to set aside $30,000 for
EIS, it may reduce its MOE by $20,000 (MOE
maximum $50,000 less $30,000 for EIS means
$20,000 can be used for MOE).
If the LEA chooses to set aside $0 for EIS,
it may reduce its MOE by $50,000 (MOE maximum $50,000 less $0 for EIS means $50,000 can
be used for MOE).
Example 2: In this example, the amount
that is 15 percent of the LEA’s total grant
(see § 300.226(a)), which is the maximum
amount that the LEA may use for EIS, is
less than the amount that may be used for
MOE reduction (50 percent of the increase in
the LEA’s grant from the prior year’s grant)
(see § 300.205(a)).
Prior Year’s Allocation ............

$1,000,000.
2,000,000.
1,000,000.

300,000.

If the LEA chooses to use no funds for
MOE, it may set aside $300,000 for EIS (EIS
maximum $300,000 less $0 means $300,000 for
EIS).
If the LEA chooses to use $100,000 for MOE,
it may set aside $200,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $100,000 means $200,000 for
EIS).
If the LEA chooses to use $150,000 for MOE,
it may set aside $150,000 for EIS (EIS maximum $300,000 less $150,000 means $150,000 for
EIS).
If the LEA chooses to use $300,000 for MOE,
it may not set aside anything for EIS (EIS
maximum $300,000 less $300,000 means $0 for
EIS).
If the LEA chooses to use $500,000 for MOE,
it may not set aside anything for EIS (EIS
maximum $300,000 less $500,000 means $0 for
EIS).
