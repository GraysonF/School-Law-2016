IC 35-50-5-3 Restitution order 
Sec. 3. (a) Except as provided in subsection (i), (j), (l), or (m), in addition to any sentence imposed under this article for a felony or misdemeanor, the court may, as a condition of probation or without placing the person on probation, order the person to make restitution to the victim of the crime, the victim's estate, or the family of a victim who is deceased. The court shall base its restitution order upon a consideration of: 
(1) 
property damages of the victim incurred as a result of the crime, based on the actual cost of repair (or replacement if repair is inappropriate); 

(2) 
medical and hospital costs incurred by the victim (before the date of sentencing) as a result of the crime;

funeral, burial, or cremation costs incurred by the family or estate of a homicide victim as a result of the crime. 


(b) 
A restitution order under subsection (a), (i), (j), (l), or (m), is a judgment lien that: 

(1) 
attaches to the property of the person subject to the order; 

(2) 
may be perfected; 

(3) 
may be enforced to satisfy any payment that is delinquent under the restitution order by the person in whose favor the order is issued or the person's assignee; and 



(4) 
expires; in the same manner as a judgment lien created in a civil proceeding. 

(c) 
When a restitution order is issued under subsection (a), the issuing court may order the person to pay the restitution, or part of the restitution, directly to: 

(1) 
the victim services division of the Indiana criminal justice institute in an amount not exceeding: 

(A) 
the amount of the award, if any, paid to the victim under IC 5-2-6.1; and 

(B) 
the cost of the reimbursements, if any, for emergency services provided to the victim under IC 16-10-1.5 (before its repeal) or IC 16-21-8; or 



(2) 
a probation department that shall forward restitution or part of restitution to: 

(A) 
a victim of a crime; 

(B) 
a victim's estate; or 





(C) 
the family of a victim who is deceased. The victim services division of the Indiana criminal justice institute 

shall deposit the restitution it receives under this subsection in the violent crime victims compensation fund established by IC 5-2-6.1-40. 

(d) 
When a restitution order is issued under subsection (a), (i), (j), (l), or (m), the issuing court shall send a certified copy of the order to the clerk of the circuit court in the county where the felony or misdemeanor charge was filed. The restitution order must include the following information: 

(1) The name and address of the person that is to receive the restitution. 

(2) 
The amount of restitution the person is to receive. Upon receiving the order, the clerk shall enter and index the order in the circuit court judgment docket in the manner prescribed by IC 33-32-3-2. The clerk shall also notify the department of insurance of an order of restitution under subsection (i). 

(e) 
An order of restitution under subsection (a), (i), (j), (l), or (m), does not bar a civil action for: 

(1) 
damages that the court did not require the person to pay to the victim under the restitution order but arise from an injury or property damage that is the basis of restitution ordered by the court; and 

(2) 
other damages suffered by the victim. 


(f) Regardless of whether restitution is required under subsection 

(a) 
as a condition of probation or other sentence, the restitution order is not discharged by the completion of any probationary period or other sentence imposed for a felony or misdemeanor. 

(g)
 A restitution order under subsection (a), (i), (j), (l), or (m), is not discharged by the liquidation of a person's estate by a receiver under IC 32-30-5 (or IC 34-48-1, IC 34-48-4, IC 34-48-5, IC 34-48-6, IC 34-1-12, or IC 34-2-7 before their repeal).

(i) 
The court may order the person convicted of an offense under IC 35-43-9 to make restitution to the victim of the crime. The court shall base its restitution order upon a consideration of the amount of money that the convicted person converted, misappropriated, or received, or for which the convicted person conspired. The restitution order issued for a violation of IC 35-43-9 must comply with subsections (b), (d), (e), and (g), and is not discharged by the completion of any probationary period or other sentence imposed for a violation of IC 35-43-9. 

(j) 
The court may order the person convicted of an offense under IC 35-43-5-3.5 to make restitution to the victim of the crime, the victim's estate, or the family of a victim who is deceased. The court shall base its restitution order upon a consideration of the amount of fraud or harm caused by the convicted person and any reasonable 

expenses (including lost wages) incurred by the victim in correcting the victim's credit report and addressing any other issues caused by the commission of the offense under IC 35-43-5-3.5. If, after a person is sentenced for an offense under IC 35-43-5-3.5, a victim, a victim's estate, or the family of a victim discovers or incurs additional expenses that result from the convicted person's commission of the offense under IC 35-43-5-3.5, the court may issue one (1) or more restitution orders to require the convicted person to make restitution, even if the court issued a restitution order at the time of sentencing. For purposes of entering a restitution order after sentencing, a court has continuing jurisdiction over a person convicted of an offense under IC 35-43-5-3.5 for five (5) years after the date of sentencing. Each restitution order issued for a violation of IC 35-43-5-3.5 must comply with subsections (b), (d), (e), and (g), and is not discharged by the completion of any probationary period or other sentence imposed for an offense under IC 35-43-5-3.5.

The value of the victim's labor as guaranteed under the minimum wage and overtime provisions of:

whichever is greater.

another person, without the consent of the property owner; to pay liquidated damages to the property owner in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or to pay actual damages to the property owner, including lost rent and the costs of decontamination by an inspector approved under IC 13-14-1-15.
