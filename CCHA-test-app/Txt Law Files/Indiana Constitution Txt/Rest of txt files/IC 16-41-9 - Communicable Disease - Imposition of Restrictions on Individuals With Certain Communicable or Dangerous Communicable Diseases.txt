IC 16-41-9-1.5 Isolation; quarantine; notice; hearing; orders; renewal; crime; rules 
Sec. 1.5. (a) If a public health authority has reason to believe that: 
(1)
 an individual: 

(A) has been infected with; or 

(B)
 has been exposed to; 
a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak; and 


(2) 
the individual is likely to cause the infection of an uninfected individual if the individual is not restricted in the individual's ability to come into contact with an uninfected individual; 


the public health authority may petition a circuit or superior court for an order imposing isolation or quarantine on the individual. A petition for isolation or quarantine filed under this subsection must be verified and include a brief description of the facts supporting the public health authority's belief that isolation or quarantine should be imposed on an individual, including a description of any efforts the public health authority made to obtain the individual's voluntary compliance with isolation or quarantine before filing the petition. 
(b) 
Except as provided in subsections (e) and (k), an individual described in subsection (a) is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard, in person or by counsel, before a court issues an order imposing isolation or quarantine. A court may restrict an individual's right to appear in person if the court finds that the individual's personal appearance is likely to expose an uninfected person to a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak. 

(c) 
If an individual is restricted from appearing in person under subsection (b), the court shall hold the hearing in a manner that allows all parties to fully and safely participate in the proceedings under the circumstances. 

(d) 
If the public health authority proves by clear and convincing evidence that: 


(1) 
an individual has been infected or exposed to a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak; and 

(2) 
the individual is likely to cause the infection of an uninfected individual if the individual is not restricted in the individual's ability to come into contact with an uninfected individual; 


the court may issue an order imposing isolation or quarantine on the individual. The court shall establish the conditions of isolation or quarantine, including the duration of isolation or quarantine. The court shall impose the least restrictive conditions of isolation or quarantine that are consistent with the protection of the public. 
(e) If the public health authority has reason to believe that an individual described in subsection (a) is likely to expose an uninfected individual to a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak before the individual described in subsection (a) can be provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard, the public health authority may seek in a circuit or superior court an emergency order of quarantine or isolation by filing a verified petition for emergency quarantine or isolation. The verified petition must include a brief description of the facts supporting the public health authority's belief that: 
(1) 
isolation or quarantine should be imposed on an individual; and 

(2) 
the individual described in subsection (a) may expose an uninfected individual to a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak before the individual described in subsection (a) can be provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard. 


The verified petition must include a description of any efforts the public health authority made to obtain the individual's voluntary compliance with isolation or quarantine before filing the petition. 
(f) If the public health authority proves by clear and convincing evidence that: 
(1) 
an individual has been infected or exposed to a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak; 

(2) 
the individual is likely to cause the infection of an uninfected individual if the individual is not restricted in the individual's ability to come into contact with an uninfected individual; and 

(3) 
the individual may expose an uninfected individual to a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak before the individual can be provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard; 


the court may issue an emergency order imposing isolation or quarantine on the individual. The court shall establish the duration and other conditions of isolation or quarantine. The court shall impose the least restrictive conditions of isolation or quarantine that are consistent with the protection of the public. 
(g) A court may issue an emergency order of isolation or quarantine without the verified petition required under subsection (e) if the court receives sworn testimony of the same facts required in the verified petition: 
(1)
 in a nonadversarial, recorded hearing before the judge; 

(2)
 orally by telephone or radio; 

(3)
 in writing by facsimile transmission (fax); or 


(4)
 through other electronic means approved by the court. If the court agrees to issue an emergency order of isolation or quarantine based upon information received under subdivision (2), the court shall direct the public health authority to sign the judge's name and to write the time and date of issuance on the proposed emergency order. If the court agrees to issue an emergency order of isolation or quarantine based upon information received under subdivision (3), the court shall direct the public health authority to transmit a proposed emergency order to the court, which the court shall sign, add the date of issuance, and transmit back to the public health authority. A court may modify the conditions of a proposed emergency order. 

(h) 
If an emergency order of isolation or quarantine is issued under subsection (g)(2), the court shall record the conversation on audiotape and order the court reporter to type or transcribe the recording for entry in the record. The court shall certify the audiotape, the transcription, and the order retained by the judge for entry in the record. 

(i) 
If an emergency order of isolation or quarantine is issued under subsection (g)(3), the court shall order the court reporter to retype or copy the facsimile transmission for entry in the record.

(j) 
The clerk shall notify the public health authority who received an emergency order under subsection (g)(2) or (g)(3) when the transcription or copy required under this section is entered in the record. The public health authority shall sign the typed, transcribed, or copied entry upon receiving notice from the court reporter. 

(k) 
The public health authority may issue an immediate order imposing isolation or quarantine on an individual if exigent circumstances, including the number of affected individuals, exist that make it impracticable for the public health authority to seek an order from a court, and obtaining the individual's voluntary compliance is or has proven impracticable or ineffective. An immediate order of isolation or quarantine expires after seventy-two 

(72) 
hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays, unless renewed in accordance with subsection (l). The public health authority shall establish the other conditions of isolation or quarantine. The public health authority shall impose the least restrictive conditions of isolation or quarantine that are consistent with the protection of the public. If the immediate order applies to a group of individuals and it is impracticable to provide individual notice, the public health authority shall post a copy of the order where it is likely to be seen by individuals subject to the order. 

(l) 
The public health authority may seek to renew an order of isolation or quarantine or an immediate order of isolation or quarantine issued under this section by doing the following: 


(1) By filing a petition to renew the emergency order of isolation or quarantine or the immediate order of isolation or quarantine with: 
(A) 
the court that granted the emergency order of isolation or quarantine; or 

(B) 
a circuit or superior court, in the case of an immediate 


order. The petition for renewal must include a brief description of the facts supporting the public health authority's belief that the individual who is the subject of the petition should remain in isolation or quarantine and a description of any efforts the public health authority made to obtain the individual's voluntary compliance with isolation or quarantine before filing the petition. 
(2) 
By providing the individual who is the subject of the emergency order of isolation or quarantine or the immediate order of isolation or quarantine with a copy of the petition and notice of the hearing at least twenty-four (24) hours before the time of the hearing. 

(3) 
By informing the individual who is the subject of the emergency order of isolation or quarantine or the immediate order of isolation or quarantine that the individual has the right to: 

(A) 
appear, unless the court finds that the individual's personal appearance may expose an uninfected person to a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak; 

(B)
 cross-examine witnesses; and 

(C) 
counsel, including court appointed counsel in accordance with subsection (c). 



(4)
 If: 

(A) the petition applies to a group of individuals; and 

(B)
 it is impracticable to provide individual notice; by posting the petition in a conspicuous location on the isolation or quarantine premises. 


(m) If the public health authority proves by clear and convincing evidence at a hearing under subsection (l) that: 
(1) 
an individual has been infected or exposed to a dangerous communicable disease or outbreak; and 

(2) 
the individual is likely to cause the infection of an uninfected individual if the individual is not restricted in the individual's ability to come into contact with an uninfected individual; 


the court may renew the existing order of isolation or quarantine or issue a new order imposing isolation or quarantine on the individual. The court shall establish the conditions of isolation or quarantine, including the duration of isolation or quarantine. The court shall impose the least restrictive conditions of isolation or quarantine that are consistent with the protection of the public. 
(n) Unless otherwise provided by law, a petition for isolation or quarantine, or a petition to renew an immediate order for isolation or quarantine, may be filed in a circuit or superior court in any county. Preferred venue for a petition described in this subsection is: 
(1) 
the county or counties (if the area of isolation or quarantine includes more than one (1) county) where the individual, premises, or location to be isolated or quarantined is located; or 

(2) 
a county adjacent to the county or counties (if the area of isolation or quarantine includes more than one (1) county) where the individual, premises, or location to be isolated or quarantined is located. 


This subsection does not preclude a change of venue for good cause shown. 
(o) 
Upon the motion of any party, or upon its own motion, a court may consolidate cases for a hearing under this section if: 

(1) 
the number of individuals who may be subject to isolation or quarantine, or who are subject to isolation or quarantine, is so large as to render individual participation impractical; 

(2) 
the law and the facts concerning the individuals are similar; and 



(3)
 the individuals have similar rights at issue. A court may appoint an attorney to represent a group of similarly situated individuals if the individuals can be adequately represented. An individual may retain his or her own counsel or proceed pro se. 

(p) 
A public health authority that imposes a quarantine that is not in the person's home: 

(1) shall allow the parent or guardian of a child who is quarantined under this section; and 

(2)
 may allow an adult; to remain with the quarantined individual in quarantine. As a condition of remaining with the quarantined individual, the public health authority may require a person described in subdivision (2) who has not been exposed to a dangerous communicable disease to receive an immunization or treatment for the disease or condition, if an immunization or treatment is available and if requiring immunization or treatment does not violate a constitutional right. 

(q) 
If an individual who is quarantined under this section is the sole parent or guardian of one (1) or more children who are not quarantined, the child or children shall be placed in the residence of a relative, friend, or neighbor of the quarantined individual until the quarantine period has expired.

If funds to pay for the court appointed attorney are not available from any other source, the state department may use the proceeds of a grant or loan to reimburse the county, state, or attorney for the costs of representation. 
(t)
 A person who knowingly or intentionally violates a condition of isolation or quarantine under this chapter commits violating quarantine or isolation, a Class A misdemeanor. 

(u) 
The state department shall adopt rules under IC 4-22-2 to implement this section, including rules to establish guidelines for: 

(1)
 voluntary compliance with isolation and quarantine; 

(2)
 quarantine locations and logistical support; and 




(3) moving individuals to and from a quarantine location. The absence of rules adopted under this subsection does not preclude the public health authority from implementing any provision of this section. As added by P.L.138-2006, SEC.6. Amended by P.L.1-2007, SEC.137; P.L.109-2015, SEC.39.
