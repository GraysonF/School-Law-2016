As used in this section, "DROP retirement date" means the future retirement date selected by a participant at the time the participant elects to enter the DROP. 

(e) 
Only a participant who is eligible to receive an unreduced annual retirement allowance immediately upon termination of employment may elect to enter a DROP. A participant who elects to enter the DROP must agree to the following: 

(1) 
The participant shall execute an irrevocable election to retire on the DROP retirement date and must remain in active service 

until that date. 

(2) 
While in the DROP, the participant shall continue to make contributions under section 8 of this chapter. 

(3) 
The participant shall select a DROP retirement date not less than twelve (12) months and not more than thirty-six (36) months after the participant's DROP entry date. 

(4) 
The participant may not remain in the DROP after the date the participant reaches the mandatory retirement age under section 9 of this chapter. 

(5) 
The participant may make an election to enter the DROP only once in the participant's lifetime. 



(f)

computed under section 10 of this chapter as if the participant had never entered the DROP; or 

(2) 
consisting of: 

(A) 
the DROP frozen benefit; plus 

(B) 
an additional amount, paid as the participant elects under subsection (i), determined by multiplying: 

(i)
 the DROP frozen benefit; by 

(ii) 
the number of months the participant was in the DROP. 







(i) 
The participant shall elect, at the participant's retirement, to receive the additional amount calculated under subsection (h)(2)(B) in one (1) of the following ways:

No cost of living increase is applied to a DROP frozen benefit while the participant is in the DROP. After the participant's DROP retirement date or the date the participant retires because of a disability as provided by subsection (k), cost of living increases determined under section 21(c) of this chapter apply to the participant's annual retirement allowance computed under this section.

(2) 
If the participant retires because of a disability at least twelve (12) months after the date the participant enters the DROP, the participant's annual retirement allowance is calculated under this section, and the participant's retirement date is the date the member retires because of a disability rather than the participant's DROP retirement date. 



(l) 
If, before payment of the participant's annual retirement allowance begins, the participant dies in the line of duty or other than in the line of duty, death benefits are payable as follows:

The benefit calculated under subsection (h)(2)(B) is paid in a lump sum to the participant's surviving spouse. If there is no surviving spouse, the lump sum must be divided equally among the participant's surviving children. If there are no surviving children, the lump sum is paid to the participant's parents. If there are no surviving parents, the lump sum is paid to the participant's estate. 

(2) 
A benefit is paid on the DROP frozen benefit under the terms of the retirement plan created by this chapter. 



(m) 
Except as provided under subsections (k) and (l), the annual retirement allowance for a participant who exits the DROP for any reason other than retirement on the participant's DROP retirement date is calculated as if the participant had never entered the DROP.
