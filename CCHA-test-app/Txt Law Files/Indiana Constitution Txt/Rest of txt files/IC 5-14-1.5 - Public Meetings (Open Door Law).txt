declare void any policy, decision, or final action: 

(A) 
taken at an executive session in violation of section 3(a) of this chapter; 

(B) 
taken at any meeting of which notice is not given in accordance with section 5 of this chapter;

meeting of which notice is not given in accordance with section 5 of this chapter; or 


(iii) series of gatherings in violation of section 3.1 of this chapter; or 
(D) taken at a meeting held in a location in violation of 
section 8 of this chapter. The plaintiff need not allege or prove special damage different from that suffered by the public at large. 
(b) Regardless of whether a formal complaint or an informal inquiry is pending before the public access counselor, any action to declare any policy, decision, or final action of a governing body void, or to enter an injunction which would invalidate any policy, decision, or final action of a governing body, based on violation of this chapter occurring before the action is commenced, shall be commenced: 
(1) 
prior to the delivery of any warrants, notes, bonds, or obligations if the relief sought would have the effect, if granted, of invalidating the notes, bonds, or obligations; or 

(2) 
with respect to any other subject matter, within thirty (30) days of either: 

(A) 
the date of the act or failure to act complained of; or 

(B) 
the date that the plaintiff knew or should have known 




that the act or failure to act complained of had occurred; whichever is later.

(c) 
If a court finds that a governing body of a public agency has violated this chapter, it may not find that the violation was cured by the governing body by only having taken final action at a meeting that complies with this chapter. 

(d) 
In determining whether to declare any policy, decision, or final action void, a court shall consider the following factors among other relevant factors: 

(1) 
The extent to which the violation:

affected the substance of the policy, decision, or final action; 

(B) 
denied or impaired access to any meetings that the public had a right to observe and record; and 

(C) 
prevented or impaired public knowledge or understanding of the public's business. 



(2) 
Whether voiding of the policy, decision, or final action is a necessary prerequisite to a substantial reconsideration of the subject matter. 

(3) 
Whether the public interest will be served by voiding the 




policy, decision, or final action by determining which of the following factors outweighs the other: 
(A) 
The remedial benefits gained by effectuating the public policy of the state declared in section 1 of this chapter. 

(B) 
The prejudice likely to accrue to the public if the policy, decision, or final action is voided, including the extent to which persons have relied upon the validity of the challenged action and the effect declaring the challenged action void would have on them.

(e)

(f) 
In any action filed under this section, a court shall award reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other reasonable expenses of litigation to the prevailing party if: 

(1) 
the plaintiff prevails; or 

(2) 
the defendant prevails and the court finds that the action is 




frivolous and vexatious. The plaintiff is not eligible for the awarding of attorney's fees, court costs, and other reasonable expenses if the plaintiff filed the action without first seeking and receiving an informal inquiry response or advisory opinion from the public access counselor, unless the plaintiff can show the filing of the action was necessary to prevent a violation of this chapter. 
(g) 
A court may assess a civil penalty under section 7.5 of this chapter only if the plaintiff obtained an advisory opinion from the public access counselor before filing an action under this section as set forth in section 7.5 of this chapter. 

(h) 
A court shall expedite the hearing of an action filed under this section.

(1) 
to the complainant and the public agency; 

(2) 
that finds that the individual or public agency violated this chapter; and 



(3)

Not more than one hundred dollars ($100) for the first violation. 

(2)

additional violation. A civil penalty imposed under this section is in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty imposed. However, in any one (1) action brought under section 7 of this chapter, a court may impose only one 
(1) 
civil penalty against an individual, even if the court finds that the individual committed multiple violations. This subsection does not preclude a court from imposing another civil penalty against an individual in a separate action, but an individual may not be assessed 

more than one (1) civil penalty in any one (1) action brought under this section. 

(g) 
A court shall distribute monthly to the auditor of state any penalties collected under this section for deposit in the education fund established by IC 5-14-4-14. 

(h) 
An individual is personally liable for a civil penalty imposed on the individual under this section. A civil penalty imposed against a public agency under this section shall be paid from the public agency's budget. 

(i) 
If an officer of a public agency directs an individual who is employed in a management level position to fail to give proper notice as described in subsection (b)(1), the management level employee is not subject to civil penalties under subsection (f).
