An agency shall make a good faith effort to identify and notify these persons, and the agency has the burden of persuasion that it has done so. The agency may request that the applicant for the order assist in the identification of these persons.

The administrative law judge may, after a prehearing order is issued under section 19 of this chapter, impose conditions upon a party necessary to avoid unreasonably burdensome or repetitious presentations by the party, such as the following: 

(1) 
Limiting the party's participation to designated issues in which the party has a particular interest demonstrated by the petition. 

(2) 
Limiting the party's use of discovery, cross-examination, and other procedures so as to promote the orderly, prompt, and just conduct of the proceeding. 

(3) 
Requiring two (2) or more parties to combine their presentations of evidence and argument, cross-examination, discovery, and other participation in the proceedings. 




If a person is allowed to intervene in the proceeding after the commencement of a hearing under this section, the administrative law judge may prohibit the intervener from recalling any witness who has been heard or reopening any matter that has been resolved, unless the intervener did not receive a notice required by this chapter or the intervener presents facts that demonstrate that fraud, perjury, or an abuse of discretion has occurred. Any proceedings conducted before the giving of a notice required by this chapter are voidable upon the motion of the party who failed to receive the notice. 
(e) 
The administrative law judge may administer oaths and affirmations and rule on any offer of proof or other motion. 

(f) 
The administrative law judge may give nonparties an opportunity to present oral or written statements. If the administrative law judge proposes to consider a statement by a nonparty, the judge shall give all parties an opportunity to challenge or rebut it and, on motion of any party, the judge shall require the 


statement to be given under oath or affirmation. 
(g) The administrative law judge shall have the hearing recorded at the agency's expense. The agency is not required, at its expense, to prepare a transcript, unless required to do so by law. Any party, at the party's expense, may cause a reporter approved by the agency to prepare a transcript from the agency's record, or cause additional recordings to be made during the hearing if the making of the additional recordings does not cause distraction or disruption. Notwithstanding IC 5-14-3-8, an agency may charge a person who requests that an agency provide a transcript (other than for judicial review under IC 4-21.5-5-13) the reasonable costs of preparing the transcript. As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. 

IC 4-21.5-3-26 Conduct of hearing; evidence 
Sec. 26. (a) This section and section 25 of this chapter govern the conduct of any hearing conducted by an administrative law judge. Upon proper objection, the administrative law judge shall exclude evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or excludable on constitutional or statutory grounds or on the basis of evidentiary privilege recognized in the courts. In the absence of proper objection, the administrative law judge may exclude objectionable evidence. The administrative law judge may admit hearsay evidence. If not objected to, the hearsay evidence may form the basis for an order. However, if the evidence is properly objected to and does not fall within a recognized exception to the hearsay rule, the resulting order may not be based solely upon the hearsay evidence. 
(b) 
All testimony of parties and witnesses must be made under oath or affirmation. 

(c) 
Statements presented by nonparties in accordance with section 25 of this chapter may be received as evidence. 

(d) 
Any part of the evidence may be received in written form if doing so will expedite the hearing without substantial prejudice to the interests of any party. 

(e) 
Documentary evidence may be received in the form of a copy or excerpt. Upon request, parties shall be given an opportunity to compare the copy with the original if available. 

(f)

(1) 
Any fact that could be judicially noticed in the courts. 

(2) 
The record of other proceedings before the agency.

(1) 
notified before or during the hearing, or before the issuance 

of any order that is based in whole or in part on facts or material noticed under subsection (f), of the specific facts or material noticed, and the source of the facts or material noticed, including any staff memoranda and data; and 

(2) 
afforded an opportunity to contest and rebut the facts or material noticed under subsection (f).

IC 4-21.5-3-27 Final orders; findings of fact and conclusions of law 
Sec. 27. (a) If the administrative law judge is the ultimate authority for the agency, the ultimate authority's order disposing of a proceeding is a final order. If the administrative law judge is not the ultimate authority, the administrative law judge's order disposing of the proceeding becomes a final order when affirmed under section 29 of this chapter. Regardless of whether the order is final, it must comply with this section. 
(b) 
This subsection applies only to an order not subject to subsection (c). The order must include, separately stated, findings of fact for all aspects of the order, including the remedy prescribed and, if applicable, the action taken on a petition for stay of effectiveness.

Findings of ultimate fact must be accompanied by a concise statement of the underlying basic facts of record to support the findings. Conclusions of law must consider prior final orders (other than negotiated orders) of the ultimate authority under the same or similar circumstances if those prior final orders are raised on the record in writing by a party and must state the reasons for deviations from those prior orders. The order must also include a statement of the available procedures and time limit for seeking administrative review of the order (if administrative review is available). 

(d) 
Findings must be based exclusively upon the evidence of record in the proceeding and on matters officially noticed in that proceeding. Findings must be based upon the kind of evidence that is substantial and reliable. The administrative law judge's experience, technical competence, and specialized knowledge may be used in evaluating evidence. 


(e) A substitute administrative law judge may issue the order under this section upon the record that was generated by a previous administrative law judge. 
(f) 
The administrative law judge may allow the parties a designated amount of time after conclusion of the hearing for the submission of proposed findings. 

(g) 
An order under this section shall be issued in writing within ninety (90) days after conclusion of the hearing or after submission of proposed findings in accordance with subsection (f), unless this period is waived or extended with the written consent of all parties or for good cause shown. 


(h) The administrative law judge shall have copies of the order under this section delivered to each party and to the ultimate authority for the agency (if it is not rendered by the ultimate authority). As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. Amended by P.L.25-1997, SEC.1; P.L.2-1998, SEC.10.

A general designation may provide procedures for the assignment of designated individuals to particular proceedings. 

(c) 
Any individual serving alone or with others in a proceeding may be disqualified for any of the reasons that an administrative law judge may be disqualified. The procedures in section 9 of this chapter apply to the disqualification and substitution of the individual.

IC 4-21.5-3-29 Orders from other than ultimate authority; review by ultimate authority; objections 
Sec. 29. (a) This section does not apply if the administrative law judge issuing an order under section 27 of this chapter is the ultimate authority for the agency. 
(b) 
After an administrative law judge issues an order under section 27 of this chapter, the ultimate authority or its designee shall issue a final order: 

(1) 
affirming; 

(2) 
modifying; or 



(3) 
dissolving; the administrative law judge's order. The ultimate authority or its designee may remand the matter, with or without instructions, to an administrative law judge for further proceedings. 

(c)
 In the absence of an objection or notice under subsection (d) or (e), the ultimate authority or its designee shall affirm the order. 

(d) 
To preserve an objection to an order of an administrative law judge for judicial review, a party must not be in default under this chapter and must object to the order in a writing that: 

(1) 
identifies the basis of the objection with reasonable particularity; and 

(2) 
is filed with the ultimate authority responsible for reviewing the order within fifteen (15) days (or any longer period set by statute) after the order is served on the petitioner. 



(e) 
Without an objection under subsection (d), the ultimate authority or its designee may serve written notice of its intent to review any issue related to the order. The notice shall be served on all parties and all other persons described by section 5(d) of this chapter. The notice must identify the issues that the ultimate 

authority or its designee intends to review. 

(f) 
A final order disposing of a proceeding or an order remanding an order to an administrative law judge for further proceedings shall be issued within sixty (60) days after the latter of:

IC 4-21.5-3-30 Review by another agency 
Sec. 30. If, under a statute, an agency may review the final order of another agency, the review shall be treated as if it was a continuous proceeding before a single agency. For the purposes of this review and the application of section 3 of this chapter concerning the effectiveness of an order, a final order of the first agency shall be treated as a nonfinal order of an administrative law judge, and the second agency shall review the order under section 29 of this chapter. To preserve an issue for judicial review, a party must comply with section 29(d) of this chapter before the second agency. The ultimate authority for the second agency or its designee may conduct proceedings under section 31 of this chapter. As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. 

IC 4-21.5-3-31 Modification of final order 
Sec. 31. (a) An agency has jurisdiction to modify a final order under this section before the earlier of the following: 
(1) 
Thirty (30) days after the agency has served the final order under section 27, 29, or 30 of this chapter. 

(2) 
Another agency assumes jurisdiction over the final order under section 30 of this chapter. 

(3) 
A court assumes jurisdiction over the final order under IC 4-21.5-5.

A party may petition the ultimate authority for an agency for a stay of effectiveness of a final order. The ultimate authority or its designee may, before or after the order becomes effective, stay the final order in whole or in part. 

(c)
 A party may petition the ultimate authority for an agency for a rehearing of a final order. The ultimate authority or its designee may grant a petition for rehearing only if the petitioning party demonstrates that: 


(1) 
the party is not in default under this chapter; 

(2) 
newly discovered material evidence exists; and 

(3) 
the evidence could not, by due diligence, have been 


discovered and produced at the hearing in the proceeding. The rehearing may be limited to the issues directly affected by the newly discovered evidence. If the rehearing is conducted by a person other than the ultimate authority, section 29 of this chapter applies to review of the order resulting from the rehearing. 
(d) Clerical mistakes and other errors resulting from oversight or omission in a final order or other part of the record of a proceeding may be corrected by an ultimate authority or its designee on the motion of any party or on the motion of the ultimate authority or its designee. 
(e) An action of a petitioning party or an agency under this section neither tolls the period in which a party may object to a second agency under section 30 of this chapter nor tolls the period in which a party may petition for judicial review under IC 4-21.5-5. However, if a rehearing is granted under subsection (c), these periods are tolled and a new period begins on the date that a new final order is served. As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. Amended by P.L.35-1987, SEC.14. 

IC 4-21.5-3-32 Final orders; public inspection; indexing; deletions; precedent 
Sec. 32. (a) Each agency shall make all written final orders available for public inspection and copying under IC 5-14-3. The agency shall index final orders that are issued after June 30, 1987, by name and subject. An agency shall index an order issued before July 1, 1987, if a person submits a written request to the agency that the order be indexed. An agency shall delete from these orders identifying details to the extent required by IC 5-14-3 or other law. In each case, the justification for the deletion must be explained in writing and attached to the order. 
(b) An agency may not rely on a written final order as precedent to the detriment of any person until the order has been made available for public inspection and indexed in the manner described in subsection (a). However, this subsection does not apply to any person who has actual timely knowledge of the order. The burden of proving that knowledge is on the agency. As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. Amended by P.L.35-1987, SEC.15. 

IC 4-21.5-3-33 Records

This section does not require any person to settle a matter under the agency's informal procedures. 

(d) 
This subsection does not apply to a proceeding before the state ethics commission (created by IC 4-2-6-2) or a proceeding concerning a regulated occupation (as defined in IC 25-1-7-1), except for a proceeding concerning a water well driller (as described in IC 25-39-3) or an out of state mobile health care entity regulated by the state department of health. When a matter is settled without the need for more elaborate proceedings under this section, the ultimate authority or its designee shall issue the order agreed to by the parties as a final order under this article. 

(e) 
When the final order referred to in subsection (d) involves the modification of a permit issued under IC 13, the administrative law judge: 

(1) 
shall remand the permit to the issuing agency with instructions to modify the permit in accordance with the final order; and 

(2) 
retains jurisdiction over any appeals of the modified permit. 




Only those terms of the permit that are the subject of the final order shall be modified and subject to public notice and comment. 
(f) Any petition for administrative review under this chapter concerning permit modification under subsection (e) is limited to only those terms of the permit modified in accordance with the final order issued under subsection (d).
