The statement processing charge is considered a part of the tax liability. 

(h) 
This subsection applies only if a statement for payment of property taxes and special assessments by electronic mail is transmitted to a person under section 8.1(h) of this chapter. If a response to the transmission of electronic mail to a person indicates that the electronic mail was not received, the county treasurer shall mail to the person a hard copy of the statement in the manner required by section 8.1(a) of this chapter for persons who do not opt to receive statements by electronic mail. The due date for the property taxes and special assessments under a statement mailed to a person under this subsection is the due date indicated in the statement transmitted to the person by electronic mail. 


(i) In a county in which an authorizing ordinance is adopted under section 8.1(h) of this chapter, a person may direct the county treasurer to transmit a reconciling statement under subsection (d)(1) by electronic mail under section 8.1(h) of this chapter.

(h) 
If an ordinance is adopted under subsection (f) to allow taxpayers to pay property taxes by automatic monthly deductions during the designated payment period from an account of the taxpayer that is held by a financial institution, the county treasurer shall provide to each county taxpayer that submits to the county treasurer the form referred to in subsection (g)(2)(C) a statement that includes at least the following:

(1) 
Determine the following: 

(A) 
For a parcel of real property, the most recently determined amount of tax liability that applied to the parcel for the preceding year.

current year. STEP THREE: Multiply the STEP ONE result by the STEP TWO result. STEP FOUR: Determine the quotient of: 
(i)
 the STEP THREE result; divided by

the number of months in the designated payment period. 


(j) 
The county treasurer may determine the monthly payment due under a monthly payment plan in an amount different from the amount determined under subsection (i) if the county treasurer

(l) 
This subsection applies only if the county treasurer determines that at the time the calculation under subsection (h)(3) is made the amount of tax liability for the current year has been determined. The amount of the taxpayer's monthly payment under a monthly payment plan is the amount of the tax liability for the current year payable in the installment or installments identified in the ordinance under subsection (g)(2)(A) divided by the number of months in the designated payment period. 

(m)

(1) 
The sum of: 

(A) 
the taxpayer's actual tax liability for the current year; plus 

(B) 
any penalty that applies for the current year. 



(2) 
The total amount paid for the current year under a monthly payment plan, and by means other than under a monthly payment plan. 

(3) 
If the amount under subdivision (1) exceeds the amount under subdivision (2), the deficiency is payable by the taxpayer: 

(A) 
as a final reconciliation of the tax liability; and 

(B) 
not later than thirty (30) days after the date of the reconciling statement. 



(4) 
If the amount under subdivision (2) exceeds the amount under subdivision (1), that the county treasurer will apply the excess as a credit against the taxpayer's tax liability for the immediately succeeding calendar year unless the taxpayer makes a claim for refund of the excess under IC 6-1.1-26. 



(p) 
The county treasurer shall deposit the tax collections under this section under IC 5-13-6-3(a). The collections must remain in the funds in which they are deposited until the county auditor makes the distributions to the appropriate taxing units at the semiannual settlements under IC 6-1.1-27. However, this subsection does not prohibit a county treasurer from making an advance to a political subdivision under IC 5-13-6-3 of a portion of the taxes collected. 

(q) IC 6-1.1-15: 
(1) 
does not apply to a statement provided under subsection (h); and 

(2) 
applies to a reconciling statement issued under subsection (o).

(2) 
If: 

(A) 
a taxpayer makes monthly payments of property taxes in an amount that is less than the amount determined by the county treasurer under subsection (i), (j), (k), or (l); and 

(B) 
the total amount of property taxes paid by the taxpayer under the monthly payment plan or any other method by the November approved monthly due date is less than the amount determined by the county treasurer under subsection (i), (j), (k), or (l) that should have been paid by the taxpayer by the November approved monthly due date; 






the penalty provisions of IC 6-1.1-37-10 apply to the delinquent property taxes. 
(s) 
IC 6-1.1-37-10 applies to any amounts due under a reconciling statement issued under subsection (o) that are not paid within thirty 

(30) 
days after the date of the reconciling statement, as required under subsection (o)(3). 


(t) For purposes of IC 6-1.1-24-1(a)(1): 
(1) 
property taxes to be paid under a monthly payment plan under this section before June of the current year are considered to be the taxpayer's spring installment of property taxes; and 

(2) 
payment on a reconciling statement issued under subsection 

(o) 
is considered to be due before the due date of the first installment of property taxes payable in the year immediately following the current year.

when the assessing officials responsible for assessing the real property make a correct assessment of the real property after taking the changes described in subdivision (1) into account, the owner may pay the amount due for the property taxes attributable to these changes in the assessment over the same number of years that match the number of years that the assessing officials took to make the correct assessment.
