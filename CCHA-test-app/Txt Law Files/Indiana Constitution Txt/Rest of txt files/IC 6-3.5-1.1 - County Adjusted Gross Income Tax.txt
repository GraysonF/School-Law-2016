The amount of the deduction is the annual amount for each year of the extension period or the annual amount of the increase over the amount that would have been paid. 

(c) 
Except as provided in this subsection, an appropriation from property taxes to make payments on a lease is not deducted from the allocation amount for a civil taxing unit or school corporation if:

 six-tenths percent (0.6%); on the adjusted gross income of county taxpayers that is in addition to the rates permitted by section 2 of this chapter. The tax rate may not be greater than the rate necessary to pay for the purposes described in subsection (b). 

(d) 
The tax rate used to pay for the purposes described in subsection (b)(1) and (b)(2) may be imposed only until the latest of the following dates: 

(1) 
The date on which the financing, construction, acquisition, improvement, and equipping of the facilities as described in subsection (b) are completed. 

(2) 
The date on which the last of any bonds issued (including refunding bonds) or leases entered into to finance the construction, acquisition, improvement, renovation, and equipping of the facilities described in subsection (b) are fully paid. 

(3) 
The date on which an ordinance adopted under subsection 

(c)
 is rescinded. 



(e) 
If the county council imposes a tax under this section to pay for the purposes described in subsection (b)(1) and (b)(2), in the year before the facilities are ready for occupancy, the county council shall by ordinance establish a tax rate at a rate permitted under subsection 

(c) 
so that the revenue from the tax rate established under this subsection does not exceed the costs of operating and maintaining the facilities described in subsection (b). The tax rate under this subsection may be imposed beginning in the year following the year the ordinance is adopted and until the date on which the ordinance adopted under this subsection is rescinded. 

(f) 
The term of a bond issued (including any refunding bond) or a lease entered into under subsection (b) may not exceed twenty-five 

(25)
 years. 

(g) 
The county treasurer shall establish a county jail revenue fund to be used only for the purposes described in this section. County 

adjusted gross income tax revenues derived from the tax rate imposed under this section shall be deposited in the county jail revenue fund before making a certified distribution under sections 10 and 11 of this chapter. 

(h) 
County adjusted gross income tax revenues derived from the tax rate imposed under this section: 

(1) 
may be used only for the purposes described in this section; 

(2) 
may not be considered by the department of local government finance in determining the county's maximum permissible property tax levy limit under IC 6-1.1-18.5; and 

(3) 
may be pledged to the repayment of bonds issued or leases entered into for the purposes described in subsection (b). 



(i) 
Rush County possesses unique governmental and economic development challenges and opportunities due to the following: 

(1) 
Deficiencies in the current county jail, including the following: 

(A) 
Aging facilities that have not been significantly improved or renovated since the original construction. 

(B) 
Lack of recreation and medical facilities. 

(C) 
Inadequate line of sight supervision of inmates due to the configuration of the aging jail. 

(D) 
Lack of adequate housing for an increasing female inmate population and for inmates with special needs. 

(E) 
Lack of adequate administrative space. 

(F) 
Increasing maintenance demands and costs resulting from having aging facilities. 



(2) 
A limited industrial and commercial assessed valuation in 




the county. The use of county adjusted gross income tax revenues as provided in this chapter is necessary for the county to provide adequate jail capacity in the county and to maintain low property tax rates essential to economic development. The use of county adjusted gross income tax revenues as provided in this chapter to pay any bonds issued or leases entered into to finance the construction, acquisition, improvement, renovation, and equipping of the facilities described in subsection (b), rather than the use of property taxes, promotes those purposes. 
(j) Notwithstanding any other law, funds accumulated from the county adjusted gross income tax imposed under this section after the termination of the tax under this section shall be transferred to the county rainy day fund under IC 36-1-8-5.1.

(b) 
Except as provided in subsection (d), the county council may rescind the county adjusted gross income tax by adopting an ordinance to rescind the tax. 

(c) 
The auditor of a county shall record all votes taken on ordinances presented for a vote under the authority of this section and, not more than ten (10) days after the vote, send a certified copy of the results to the commissioner of the department, the director of the budget agency, and the commissioner of the department of local government finance in an electronic format approved by the director of the budget agency. 


(d) A county council may not rescind the county adjusted gross income tax or take any action that would result in a civil taxing unit in the county having a smaller certified share than the certified share to which the civil taxing unit was entitled when the civil taxing unit pledged county adjusted gross income tax if the civil taxing unit or any commission, board, department, or authority that is authorized by statute to pledge county adjusted gross income tax has pledged county adjusted gross income tax for any purpose permitted by IC 5-1-14 or any other statute. The prohibition in this section does not apply if the civil taxing unit pledges legally available revenues to fully replace the civil taxing unit's certified share that has been pledged.

Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following repeal of this chapter, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 5. (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) through (c), if the county adjusted gross income tax is not in effect during a county taxpayer's entire taxable year, then the amount of county adjusted gross income tax that the county taxpayer owes for that taxable year equals the product of: 
(1) 
the amount of county adjusted gross income tax the county taxpayer would owe if the tax had been imposed during the county taxpayer's entire taxable year; multiplied by 

(2) 
a fraction: 

(A) 
The numerator of the fraction equals the number of days during the county taxpayer's taxable year during which the county adjusted gross income tax was in effect. 

(B) 
The denominator of the fraction equals the total number of days in the county taxpayer's taxable year. 




(b) If a county taxpayer: 
(1) 
is unemployed for a part of the taxpayer's taxable year; 

(2) 
was not discharged for just cause (as defined in IC 22-4-15-1(e)); and 

(3) 
has no earned income for the part of the taxpayer's taxable 


year that the tax was in effect; the county taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year is reduced by the amount of the taxpayer's earned income for the taxable year. 
(c) A taxpayer who qualifies under subsection (b) must file a claim for a refund for the difference between the county adjusted gross income tax owed, as determined under subsection (a), and the tax owed, as determined under subsection (b). A claim for a refund must be on a form approved by the department and include all supporting documentation reasonably required by the department. As added by P.L.73-1983, SEC.2.

Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following repeal of this chapter, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 6. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), if for a particular taxable year a county taxpayer is liable for an income tax imposed by a county, city, town, or other local governmental entity located outside of Indiana, that county taxpayer is entitled to a credit against his county adjusted gross income tax liability for that same taxable year. The amount of the credit equals the amount of tax imposed by the other governmental entity on income derived from sources outside Indiana and subject to the county adjusted gross income tax. However, the credit provided by this section may not reduce a county taxpayer's county adjusted gross income tax liability to an amount less than would have been owed if the income subject to taxation by the other governmental entity had been ignored. 
(b) The credit provided by this section does not apply to a county taxpayer to the extent that the other governmental entity provides for a credit to the taxpayer for the amount of county adjusted gross income taxes owed under this chapter. 
(c) To claim the credit provided by this section, a county taxpayer must provide the department with satisfactory evidence that he is entitled to the credit. As added by P.L.73-1983, SEC.2.

Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following repeal of this chapter, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 9. (a) Revenue derived from the imposition of the county adjusted gross income tax shall, in the manner prescribed by this section, be distributed to the county that imposed it. The amount to be distributed to a county during an ensuing calendar year equals the amount of county adjusted gross income tax revenue that the budget agency determines has been: 
(1) 
received from that county for a taxable year ending before the calendar year in which the determination is made; and 

(2) 
reported on an annual return or amended return processed by the department in the state fiscal year ending before July 1 of the calendar year in which the determination is made; 


as adjusted for refunds of county adjusted gross income tax made in the state fiscal year. 
(b) Before August 2 of each calendar year, the budget agency shall provide to the county auditor of each adopting county an estimate of the amount determined under subsection (a) that will be distributed to the county, based on known tax rates. Not later than thirty (30) days after receiving the estimate of the certified distribution, the county auditor shall notify each taxing unit of the estimated amount of property tax replacement credits, certified shares, and other revenue that will be distributed to the taxing unit under this chapter during the ensuing calendar year. Before October 1 of each calendar year, the budget agency shall certify to the county auditor of each adopting county the amount determined under subsection (a) plus the amount of interest in the county's account that has accrued and has not been included in a certification made in a preceding year. The amount certified is the county's "certified distribution" for the immediately succeeding calendar year. The amount certified shall be adjusted under subsections (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g). Not later than thirty (30) days after receiving the notice of the amount of the certified distribution, the county auditor shall notify each taxing unit of the amount of property tax replacement credits, certified shares, and other revenue that will be distributed to the taxing unit under this chapter during the ensuing calendar year. The budget agency shall provide the county council with an informative summary of the calculations used to determine the certified distribution. The summary of calculations must include: 
(1) 
the amount reported on individual income tax returns processed by the department during the previous fiscal year; 

(2) 
adjustments for over distributions in prior years; 

(3) 
adjustments for clerical or mathematical errors in prior years; 

(4) 
adjustments for tax rate changes; and 

(5) 
the amount of excess account balances to be distributed 


under IC 6-3.5-1.1-21.1. The budget agency shall also certify information concerning the part of the certified distribution that is attributable to a tax rate under section 24, 25, or 26 of this chapter. This information must be certified to the county auditor, the department, and the department of local government finance before October 1 of each calendar year. The part of the certified distribution that is attributable to a tax rate under section 24, 25, or 26 of this chapter may be used only as specified in those provisions. 
(c) 
The budget agency shall certify an amount less than the amount determined under subsection (b) if the budget agency determines that the reduced distribution is necessary to offset overpayments made in a calendar year before the calendar year of the distribution. The budget agency may reduce the amount of the certified distribution over several calendar years so that any overpayments are offset over several years rather than in one (1) lump sum. 

(d) 
The budget agency shall adjust the certified distribution of a county to correct for any clerical or mathematical errors made in any previous certification under this section. The budget agency may reduce the amount of the certified distribution over several calendar years so that any adjustment under this subsection is offset over several years rather than in one (1) lump sum. 

(e) 
This subsection applies to a county that initially imposes, increases, decreases, or rescinds a tax or tax rate under this chapter before November 1 in the same calendar year in which the budget agency makes a certification under this section. The budget agency shall adjust the certified distribution of a county to provide for a distribution in the immediately following calendar year and in each calendar year thereafter. The budget agency shall provide for a full transition to certification of distributions as provided in subsection (a)(1) through (a)(2) in the manner provided in subsection (c). If the county imposes, increases, decreases, or rescinds a tax or tax rate 

under this chapter after the date for which a certification under subsection (b) is based, the budget agency shall adjust the certified distribution of the county after September 30 of the calendar year. The adjustment shall reflect any other adjustment required under subsections (c), (d), (f), and (g). The adjusted certification shall be treated as the county's "certified distribution" for the immediately succeeding calendar year. The budget agency shall certify the adjusted certified distribution to the county auditor for the county and provide the county council with an informative summary of the calculations that revises the informative summary provided in subsection (b) and reflects the changes made in the adjustment. 

(f) 
The budget agency shall adjust the certified distribution of a county to provide the county with the distribution required under section 3.3 of this chapter beginning not later than the tenth month after the month in which additional revenue from the tax authorized under section 3.3 of this chapter is initially collected. 

(g) 
This subsection applies in the year in which a county initially imposes a tax rate under section 24 of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision, the budget agency shall adjust the part of the county's certified distribution that is attributable to the tax rate under section 24 of this chapter to provide for a distribution in the immediately following calendar year equal to the result of: 

(1) 
the sum of the amounts determined under STEP ONE through STEP FOUR of IC 6-3.5-1.5-1(b) in the year in which the county initially imposes a tax rate under section 24 of this chapter; multiplied by 

(2) 
two (2). 



(h) 
The budget agency shall before May 1 of every odd-numbered year publish an estimate of the statewide total amount of certified distributions to be made under this chapter during the following two 

(2) 
calendar years. 

(i) 
The budget agency shall before May 1 of every even-numbered year publish an estimate of the statewide total amount of certified distributions to be made under this chapter during the following calendar year. 


(j) The estimates under subsections (h) and (i) must specify the amount of the estimated certified distributions that are attributable to the additional rate authorized under section 24 of this chapter, the additional rate authorized under section 25 of this chapter, the additional rate authorized under section 26 of this chapter, and any other additional rates authorized under this chapter.

(b) Except as provided in section 13 of this chapter, the amount of property tax replacement credits that each civil taxing unit and school corporation in a county is entitled to receive during a calendar year equals the product of: 
(1) 
that part of the county's certified distribution that is dedicated to providing property tax replacement credits for that same calendar year; multiplied by 

(2) 
a fraction: 

(A)

Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following repeal of this chapter, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 13. (a) If a civil taxing unit or school corporation of an adopting county does not impose a property tax levy that is first due and payable in a calendar year in which property tax replacement credits are being distributed, that civil taxing unit or school corporation is entitled to receive a proportion of the property tax replacement credits to be distributed within the county. The amount such a civil taxing unit or school corporation is entitled to receive during that calendar year equals the product of: 
(1) 
the part of the county's certified distribution that is to be used to provide property tax replacement credits during that calendar year; multiplied by 

(2) 
a fraction: 

(A) 
The numerator of the fraction equals the budget of that civil taxing unit or school corporation for that calendar year. 

(B) 
The denominator of the fraction equals the aggregate budgets of all civil taxing units and school corporations of that county for that calendar year. 




(b) If for a calendar year a civil taxing unit or school corporation is allocated a proportion of a county's property tax replacement credits by this section then the formula used in section 12 of this chapter to determine all other civil taxing units' and school corporations' property tax replacement credits shall be changed for that same year by reducing the amount dedicated to providing property tax replacement credits by the amount of property tax replacement credits allocated under this section for that same calendar year. The department of local government finance shall make any adjustments required by this section and provide them to the appropriate county auditors. As added by P.L.73-1983, SEC.2.

IC 6-3.5-1.1-14 Version a Replacement credits; determination limited; multiple county taxing units; effect upon budget, property tax rates, and school funds 
Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following repeal of this chapter, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 14. (a) In determining the amount of property tax replacement credits civil taxing units and school corporations of a county are entitled to receive during a calendar year, the department of local government finance shall consider only property taxes imposed on tangible property that was assessed in that county. 
(b) 
If a civil taxing unit or a school corporation is located in more than one (1) county and receives property tax replacement credits from one (1) or more of the counties, then the property tax replacement credits received from each county shall be used only to reduce the property tax rates that are imposed within the county that distributed the property tax replacement credits. 

(c) 
A civil taxing unit shall treat any property tax replacement credits that it receives or is to receive during a particular calendar year as a part of its property tax levy for that same calendar year for purposes of fixing its budget and for purposes of the property tax levy limits imposed by IC 6-1.1-18.5. 

(d) 
Subject to subsection (e), if a civil taxing unit or school corporation of an adopting county does not impose a property tax levy that is first due and payable in a calendar year in which property tax replacement credits are being distributed, the civil taxing unit or school corporation is entitled to use the property tax replacement credits distributed to the civil taxing unit or school corporation for any purpose for which a property tax levy could be used. 


(e) A school corporation shall treat any property tax replacement credits that the school corporation receives or is to receive during a particular calendar year as a part of its property tax levy for its debt service fund, capital projects fund, transportation fund, and school bus replacement fund in proportion to the levy for each of these funds for that same calendar year for purposes of fixing its budget. A school corporation shall allocate the property tax replacement credits described in this subsection to all four (4) funds in proportion to the levy for each fund. As added by P.L.73-1983, SEC.2. Amended by P.L.25-1995, SEC.56; P.L.90-2002, SEC.295; P.L.207-2005, SEC.4; P.L.2-2006, SEC.69; P.L.146-2008, SEC.328; P.L.182-2009(ss), SEC.211. 

IC 6-3.5-1.1-15 Version a Attributed allocation amount; allocation of certified shares 
Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following repeal of this chapter, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 15. (a) As used in this section, "attributed allocation amount" of a civil taxing unit for a calendar year means the sum of: 
(1) 
the allocation amount of the civil taxing unit for that calendar year; plus 

(2) 
the current ad valorem property tax levy of any special taxing district, authority, board, or other entity formed to discharge governmental services or functions on behalf of or ordinarily attributable to the civil taxing unit; plus 

(3) 
in the case of a county, an amount equal to the welfare 


allocation amount. The welfare allocation amount is an amount equal to the sum of the property taxes imposed by the county in 1999 for the county's welfare fund and welfare administration fund and, if the county received a certified distribution under this chapter or IC 6-3.5-6 in 2008, the property taxes imposed by the county in 2008 for the county's county medical assistance to wards fund, family and children's fund, children's psychiatric residential treatment services fund, county hospital care for the indigent fund and children with special health care needs county fund. 
(b) The part of a county's certified distribution that is to be used as certified shares shall be allocated only among the county's civil taxing units. Each civil taxing unit of a county is entitled to receive a certified share during a calendar year in an amount determined in STEP TWO of the following formula: 
STEP ONE: Divide: 
(A) 
the attributed allocation amount of the civil taxing unit during that calendar year; by 

(B) 
the sum of the attributed allocation amounts of all the 


civil taxing units of the county during that calendar year. STEP TWO: Multiply the part of the county's certified distribution that is to be used as certified shares by the STEP ONE amount. 
(c) 
The department of local government finance shall determine the attributed levies of civil taxing units that are entitled to receive certified shares during a calendar year. If the ad valorem property tax levy of any special taxing district, authority, board, or other entity is attributed to another civil taxing unit under subsection (a)(2), then the special taxing district, authority, board, or other entity shall not be treated as having an attributed allocation amount of its own. The department of local government finance shall certify the attributed allocation amounts to the appropriate county auditor. The county auditor shall then allocate the certified shares among the civil taxing units of the auditor's county. 

(d) 
Certified shares received by a civil taxing unit shall be treated as additional revenue for the purpose of fixing its budget for the calendar year during which the certified shares will be received. The certified shares may be allocated to or appropriated for any purpose, including property tax relief or a transfer of funds to another civil taxing unit whose levy was attributed to the civil taxing unit in the determination of its attributed allocation amount.

(b) 
The residence or principal place of business or employment of an individual is to be determined on January 1 of the calendar year in which the individual's taxable year commences. If an individual changes the location of his residence or principal place of employment or business to another county in Indiana during a calendar year, his liability for county adjusted gross income tax is not affected. 

(c) 
Notwithstanding subsection (b), if an individual becomes a county taxpayer for purposes of IC 36-7-27 during a calendar year because the individual: 

(1) 
changes the location of the individual's residence to a county in which the individual begins employment or business at a qualified economic development tax project (as defined in IC 36-7-27-9); or 

(2) 
changes the location of the individual's principal place of employment or business to a qualified economic development tax project and does not reside in another county in which the county adjusted gross income tax is in effect; 




the individual's adjusted gross income attributable to employment or business at the qualified economic development tax project is taxable only by the county containing the qualified economic development tax project.

(g) Except as provided in subsection (t), the department of local government finance shall determine the following property tax replacement distribution amounts: 
STEP ONE: Determine the sum of the amounts determined under STEP ONE through STEP FOUR of IC 6-3.5-1.5-1(b) for the county in the preceding year. STEP TWO: For distribution to each civil taxing unit that in the year had a maximum permissible property tax levy limited under IC 6-1.1-18.5-3(b), determine the result of: 
(1) 
the quotient of: 

(A) 
the part of the amount determined under STEP ONE of IC 6-3.5-1.5-1(b) in the preceding year that was attributable to the civil taxing unit; divided by 

(B) 
the STEP ONE amount; multiplied by 



(2) 
the tax revenue received by the county treasurer under 


this section. STEP THREE: For distributions in 2009 and thereafter, the result of this STEP is zero (0). For distribution to the county for deposit in the county family and children's fund before 2009, determine the result of: 
(1) 
the quotient of: 

(A) 
the amount determined under STEP TWO of IC 6-3.5-1.5-1(b) in the preceding year; divided by 

(B) 
the STEP ONE amount; multiplied by 



(2) 
the tax revenue received by the county treasurer under 


this section. STEP FOUR: For distributions in 2009 and thereafter, the result of this STEP is zero (0). For distribution to the county for deposit in the county children's psychiatric residential treatment services fund before 2009, determine the result of:

the quotient of: 

(A) 
the amount determined under STEP THREE of IC 6-3.5-1.5-1(b) in the preceding year; divided by 

(B) 
the STEP ONE amount; multiplied by 



(2) 
the tax revenue received by the county treasurer under 


this section. STEP FIVE: For distribution to the county for community mental health center purposes, determine the result of: 
(1) 
the quotient of:

(B) 
the STEP ONE amount; multiplied by 



(2) 
the tax revenue received by the county treasurer under 


this section. Except as provided in subsection (m), the county treasurer shall distribute the portion of the certified distribution that is attributable to a tax rate under this section as specified in this section. The county treasurer shall make the distributions under this subsection at the same time that distributions are made to civil taxing units under section 15 of this chapter.

the maximum income tax rate that may be imposed in a county under section 2 of this chapter or any other provision of this chapter; or 

(2) 
the maximum permissible property tax levy under IC 6-1.1-18.5-3.

Except as provided in subsections (s) and (t), a distribution under this section shall be treated as a part of the receiving civil taxing unit's property tax levy for that year for purposes of fixing the budget of the civil taxing unit and for determining the distribution of taxes that are distributed on the basis of property tax levies. 

(l) 
If a county council imposes a tax rate under this section (other than a tax rate imposed under subsection (s)), the portion of county adjusted gross income tax revenue dedicated to property tax replacement credits under section 11 of this chapter may not be decreased. 

(m) 
In the year following the year in a which a county first imposes a tax rate under this section, one-half (1/2) of the tax revenue that is attributable to the tax rate under this section (other than a tax rate imposed under subsection (s)) must be deposited in the county stabilization fund established under subsection (o). 

(n) 
Except as provided in subsection (t) and IC 8-25, a pledge of county adjusted gross income taxes does not apply to revenue attributable to a tax rate under this section. 

(o) 
Except as provided in subsection (t), a county stabilization fund is established in each county that imposes a tax rate under this section. The county stabilization fund shall be administered by the county auditor. If for a year the certified distributions attributable to a tax rate under this section exceed the amount calculated under STEP ONE through STEP FOUR of IC 6-3.5-1.5-1(b) that is used by 


the department of local government finance and the department of state revenue to determine the tax rate under this section, the excess shall be deposited in the county stabilization fund. Money shall be distributed from the county stabilization fund in a year by the county auditor to political subdivisions entitled to a distribution of tax revenue attributable to the tax rate under this section if:

(2) 
the certified distributions attributable to a tax rate under this section in a year are less than the certified distributions attributable to a tax rate under this section in the preceding year.

(p) 
Notwithstanding any other provision, a tax rate imposed under this section may not exceed one percent (1%). 

(q) 
A county council must each year hold at least one (1) public meeting at which the county council discusses whether the tax rate under this section should be imposed or increased. 

(r) 
The department of local government finance and the department of state revenue may take any actions necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. 

(s) 
This subsection applies only to Hancock County and Johnson County. If the voters of the county approve a local public question under IC 8-25-2, the fiscal body of the county may adopt an ordinance to provide for the use of county adjusted gross income tax revenues attributable to an additional tax rate imposed under this subsection to fund a public transportation project under IC 8-25. However, a county fiscal body shall adopt an ordinance under this subsection if required by IC 8-25-6-10 to impose an additional tax rate on the county taxpayers who reside in a township in which the voters approve a public transportation project in a local public question held under IC 8-25-6. An ordinance adopted under this subsection must specify an additional tax rate to be imposed in the county (or township in the case of an additional rate required by IC 8-25-6-10) of at least one-tenth percent (0.1%), but not more than twenty-five hundredths percent (0.25%). If an ordinance is adopted under this subsection, the amount of the certified distribution attributable to the additional tax rate imposed under this subsection must be: 

(1) 
retained by the county auditor; 

(2) 
deposited in the public transportation project fund established under IC 8-25-3-7; and 

(3) 
used for the purpose provided in this subsection instead of 




as a property tax replacement distribution. 
(t) The following do not apply to an additional tax rate imposed under subsection (s): 
(1)

IC 6-3.5-1.1-26 Version a Rate for property tax relief 
Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following repeal of this chapter, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 26. (a) A county council may impose a tax rate under this section to provide property tax relief to taxpayers in the county. A county council is not required to impose any other tax before imposing a tax rate under this section. 
(b) 
A tax rate under this section may be imposed in increments of five hundredths of one percent (0.05%) determined by the county council. A tax rate under this section may not exceed one percent (1%). 

(c) 
A tax rate under this section is in addition to any other tax rates imposed under this chapter and does not affect the purposes for which other tax revenue under this chapter may be used. 

(d) 
If a county council adopts an ordinance to impose or increase a tax rate under this section, not more than ten (10) days after the vote, the county auditor shall send a certified copy of the ordinance to the commissioner of the department, the director of the budget 

agency, and the commissioner of the department of local government finance in an electronic format approved by the director of the budget agency. 

(e) 
A tax rate under this section may be imposed, increased, decreased, or rescinded by a county council at the same time and in the same manner that the county council may impose or increase a tax rate under section 24 of this chapter. 

(f) 
Tax revenue attributable to a tax rate under this section may be used for any combination of the following purposes, as specified by ordinance of the county council: 

(1) 
Except as provided in subsection (j), the tax revenue may be used to provide local property tax replacement credits at a uniform rate to all taxpayers in the county. The local property tax replacement credits shall be treated for all purposes as property tax levies. The county auditor shall determine the local property tax replacement credit percentage for a particular year based on the amount of tax revenue that will be used under this subdivision to provide local property tax replacement credits in that year. A county council may not adopt an ordinance determining that tax revenue shall be used under this subdivision to provide local property tax replacement credits at a uniform rate to all taxpayers in the county unless the county council has done the following: 

(A) 
Made available to the public the county council's best estimate of the amount of property tax replacement credits to be provided under this subdivision to homesteads, other residential property, commercial property, industrial property, and agricultural property. 

(B) 
Adopted a resolution or other statement acknowledging that some taxpayers in the county that do not pay the tax rate under this section will receive a property tax replacement credit that is funded with tax revenue from the tax rate under this section. 



(2) 
The tax revenue may be used to uniformly provide the homestead credit percentage in the county. The homestead credits shall be treated for all purposes as property tax levies. The homestead credits do not reduce the basis for determining any state homestead credit. The homestead credits shall be applied to the net property taxes due on the homestead after the application of all other assessed value deductions or property tax deductions and credits that apply to the amount owed under IC 6-1.1. The county auditor shall determine the homestead credit percentage for a particular year based on the amount of tax revenue that will be used under this subdivision to provide homestead credits in that year. 

(3) 
The tax revenue may be used to provide local property tax replacement credits at a uniform rate for all qualified residential property (as defined in IC 6-1.1-20.6-4 before January 1, 2009, 

and as defined in section 1 of this chapter after December 31, 2008) in the county. The local property tax replacement credits shall be treated for all purposes as property tax levies. The county auditor shall determine the local property tax replacement credit percentage for a particular year based on the amount of tax revenue that will be used under this subdivision to provide local property tax replacement credits in that year. 

(4) 
This subdivision applies only to Lake County. The Lake County council may adopt an ordinance providing that the tax revenue from the tax rate under this section is used for any of the following: 

(A) 
To reduce all property tax levies imposed by the county by the granting of property tax replacement credits against those property tax levies. 

(B) 
To provide local property tax replacement credits in Lake County in the following manner: 

(i) 
The tax revenue under this section that is collected from taxpayers within a particular municipality in Lake County (as determined by the department based on the department's best estimate) shall be used only to provide a local property tax credit against property taxes imposed by that municipality. 

(ii) 
The tax revenue under this section that is collected from taxpayers within the unincorporated area of Lake County (as determined by the department) shall be used only to provide a local property tax credit against property taxes imposed by the county. The local property tax credit for the unincorporated area of Lake County shall be available only to those taxpayers within the unincorporated area of the county. 



(C) 
To provide property tax credits in the following manner: 

(i) 
Sixty percent (60%) of the tax revenue under this section shall be used as provided in clause (B). 

(ii) 
Forty percent (40%) of the tax revenue under this section shall be used to provide property tax replacement credits against property tax levies of the county and each township and municipality in the county. The percentage of the tax revenue distributed under this item that shall be used as credits against the county's levies or against a particular township's or municipality's levies is equal to the percentage determined by dividing the population of the county, township, or municipality by the sum of the total population of the county, each township in the county, and each municipality in the county. 








The Lake County council shall determine whether the credits under clause (A), (B), or (C) shall be provided to homesteads, to all qualified residential property, or to all taxpayers. The department of local government finance, with the assistance of the budget agency, shall certify to the county auditor and the fiscal body of the county and each township and municipality in the county the amount of property tax credits under this subdivision. Except as provided in subsection (g), the tax revenue under this section that is used to provide credits under this subdivision shall be treated for all purposes as property tax levies. 
The county council may adopt an ordinance changing the purposes for which tax revenue attributable to a tax rate under this section shall be used in the following year. 
(g) 
The tax rate under this section and the tax revenue attributable to the tax rate under this section shall not be considered for purposes of computing: 

(1) 
the maximum income tax rate that may be imposed in a county under section 2 of this chapter or any other provision of this chapter; 

(2) 
the maximum permissible property tax levy under IC 6-1.1-18.5-3; or 

(3) 
the credit under IC 6-1.1-20.6. 



(h) 
Tax revenue under this section shall be treated as a part of the receiving civil taxing unit's or school corporation's property tax levy for that year for purposes of fixing the budget of the civil taxing unit or school corporation and for determining the distribution of taxes that are distributed on the basis of property tax levies. To the extent the county auditor determines that there is income tax revenue remaining from the tax under this section after providing the property tax replacement credits, the excess shall be credited to a dedicated county account and may be used only for property tax replacement credits under this section in subsequent years. 

(i) 
The department of local government finance and the department of state revenue may take any actions necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. 

(j) 
A taxpayer that owns an industrial plant located in Jasper County is ineligible for a local property tax replacement credit under this section against the property taxes due on the industrial plant if the assessed value of the industrial plant as of March 1, 2006, exceeds twenty percent (20%) of the total assessed value of all taxable property in the county on that date. The general assembly finds that the provisions of this subsection are necessary because the industrial plant represents such a large percentage of Jasper County's assessed valuation.
