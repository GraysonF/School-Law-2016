However, the interest charged on the loan may not exceed the percent of increase in the United States Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers during the most recent twelve (12) month period for which data is available as of the date that the unit applies for a loan under this chapter. In the case of a qualified taxing unit that is not a school corporation or a public library (as defined in IC 36-12-1-5), a loan must be repaid not later than ten (10) years after the date on which the loan was made.

A school corporation or a public library (as defined in IC 36-12-1-5) is not required to begin making payments to repay a loan until after June 30, 2004. The total amount of all the loans made under this chapter may not exceed twenty-eight million dollars ($28,000,000). The board may disburse the proceeds of a loan in installments.

(2) 
in the case of a school corporation, the school corporation's debt service fund; or 

(3) 
any other source of revenues (other than property taxes) that 


is legally available to the qualified taxing unit. The payment of any installment of principal constitutes a first charge against the property tax revenues described in subdivision (1) that are collected by the qualified taxing unit during the calendar year the installment is due and payable. 
(c)
 The obligation to repay a loan made under this chapter is not a basis for the qualified taxing unit to obtain an excessive tax levy under IC 6-1.1-18.5.

IC 6-1.1-21.8-5 Maximum loan amount for a particular qualified taxing unit 
Sec. 5. The maximum amount that the board may loan to a qualified taxing unit is determined under STEP FOUR of the following formula: 
STEP ONE: Determine the amount of the taxpayer's property 
taxes due and payable in November 2001 that are attributable 
to the qualified taxing unit as determined by the department of 
local government finance. 
STEP TWO: Multiply the STEP ONE amount by one and 
thirty-one thousandths (1.031). 
STEP THREE: Multiply the STEP TWO product by two (2). 
STEP FOUR: Add the STEP ONE amount to the STEP THREE 
product. However, in the case of a qualified taxing unit that is a school corporation, the amount determined under STEP FOUR shall be reduced by the board to the extent that the school corporation receives relief in the form of adjustments to the school corporation's net assessed valuation under IC 6-1.1-17-0.5 or assessed valuation under IC 6-1.1-19-5.3. As added by P.L.157-2002, SEC.1. Amended by P.L.2-2006, SEC.63; P.L.146-2008, SEC.245; P.L.137-2012, SEC.38. 

IC 6-1.1-21.8-6 "Delinquent tax"; loan proceeds and delinquent tax payments; calculation of levy excess; expenditure of loan receipts 
Sec. 6. (a) As used in this section, "delinquent tax" means any tax: 
(1) 
owed by a taxpayer in a bankruptcy proceeding initially filed in 2001; and 

(2) 
not paid during the calendar year in which it was first due and payable. 


(b) 
Except as provided in subsection (d), the proceeds of a loan received by the qualified taxing unit under this chapter are not considered to be part of the ad valorem property tax levy actually collected by the qualified taxing unit for taxes first due and payable during a particular calendar year for the purpose of calculating the levy excess under IC 6-1.1-18.5-17 and IC 20-44-3. The receipt by a qualified taxing unit of any payment of delinquent tax owed by a taxpayer in bankruptcy is considered to be part of the ad valorem 

property tax levy actually collected by the qualified taxing unit for taxes first due and payable during a particular calendar year for the purpose of calculating the levy excess under IC 6-1.1-18.5-17 and IC 20-44-3. 

(c)
 The proceeds of a loan made under this chapter must first be used to retire any outstanding loans made by the department of commerce (including any loans made by the department of commerce that are transferred to the Indiana economic development corporation) to cover a qualified taxing unit's revenue shortfall resulting from the taxpayer's default on property tax payments. Any remaining proceeds of a loan made under this chapter and any payment of delinquent taxes by the taxpayer may be expended by the qualified taxing unit only to pay obligations of the qualified taxing unit that have been incurred under appropriations for operating expenses made by the qualified taxing unit and approved by the department of local government finance. 

(d) 
If the sum of the receipts of a qualified taxing unit that are attributable to: 

(1) 
the loan proceeds; and 

(2) 
the payment of property taxes owed by a taxpayer in a bankruptcy proceeding and payable in November 2001, May 2002, or November 2002; 




exceeds the sum of the taxpayer's property tax liability attributable to the qualified taxing unit for property taxes payable in November 2001, May 2002, and November 2002, the excess as received during any calendar year or years shall be set aside and treated for the calendar year when received as a levy excess subject to IC 6-1.1-18.5-17 or IC 20-44-3. In calculating the payment of property taxes as referred to in subdivision (2), the amount of property tax credit finally allowed under IC 6-1.1-21-5 (before its repeal) in respect to those taxes is considered to be a payment of those property taxes.
