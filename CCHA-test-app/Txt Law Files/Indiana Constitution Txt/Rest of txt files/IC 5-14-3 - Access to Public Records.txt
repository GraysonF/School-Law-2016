IC 5-14-3 Chapter 3. Access to Public Records 
IC 5-14-3-1 Public policy; construction; burden of proof for nondisclosure 
Sec. 1. A fundamental philosophy of the American constitutional form of representative government is that government is the servant of the people and not their master. Accordingly, it is the public policy of the state that all persons are entitled to full and complete information regarding the affairs of government and the official acts of those who represent them as public officials and employees. Providing persons with the information is an essential function of a representative government and an integral part of the routine duties of public officials and employees, whose duty it is to provide the information. This chapter shall be liberally construed to implement this policy and place the burden of proof for the nondisclosure of a public record on the public agency that would deny access to the record and not on the person seeking to inspect and copy the record. As added by P.L.19-1983, SEC.6. Amended by P.L.77-1995, SEC.1.

(1) 
identify with reasonable particularity the record being requested; and 

(2) 
be, at the discretion of the agency, in writing on or in a form 


provided by the agency. No request may be denied because the person making the request refuses to state the purpose of the request, unless such condition is required by other applicable statute. If a request is for inspection or copying of a law enforcement recording, the request must provide the information required under subsection (i). 
(b) 
A public agency may not deny or interfere with the exercise of the right stated in subsection (a). Within a reasonable time after the request is received by the agency, the public agency shall either:

This subsection does not apply to an electronic map. 

(e)

(f)
 Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, a public agency is not required to create or provide copies of lists of names and addresses (including electronic mail account addresses) unless the public agency is required to publish such lists and disseminate them to the public under a statute. However, if a public agency has 


created a list of names and addresses (excluding electronic mail account addresses), it must permit a person to inspect and make memoranda abstracts from the list unless access to the list is prohibited by law. The lists of names and addresses (including electronic mail account addresses) described in subdivisions (1) through (3) may not be disclosed by public agencies to any individual or entity for political purposes and may not be used by any individual or entity for political purposes. In addition, the lists of names and addresses (including electronic mail account addresses) described in subdivisions (1) through (3) may not be disclosed by public agencies to commercial entities for commercial purposes and may not be used by commercial entities for commercial purposes.

A list of employees of a public agency. 

(2) 
A list of persons attending conferences or meetings at a state educational institution or of persons involved in programs or activities conducted or supervised by the state educational institution. 

(3)

(1) 
for the storage or copying of public records; or 

(2) 
that requires the public to obtain a license or pay copyright royalties for obtaining the right to inspect and copy the records unless otherwise provided by applicable statute; 


if the contract, obligation, license, or copyright unreasonably impairs the right of the public to inspect and copy the agency's public records. 
(h) 
If this section conflicts with IC 3-7, the provisions of IC 3-7 apply. 

(i) 
A request to inspect or copy a law enforcement recording must be in writing.

(2) 
The specific location where the law enforcement activity occurred. 

(3)

(B) 
reveal information that would have a reasonable likelihood of threatening public safety.

matches the previously disclosed information.

(h) 
If the court, after the disposition of any interlocutory appeals, finds that the agency's refusal to confirm or deny was improper, the court shall order the agency to disclose whether the record exists or does not exist. If the record exists and the agency claims that the record is exempt from disclosure under this chapter, the court may review the public record in camera to determine whether any part of the record may be withheld. 

(i) 
In an action filed under this section, the court shall award reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, and other reasonable expenses of litigation to the prevailing party if: 

(1) 
the plaintiff substantially prevails; or 

(2) 
the defendant substantially prevails and the court finds the 




action was frivolous or vexatious. A plaintiff is eligible for the awarding of attorney's fees, court costs, and other reasonable expenses regardless of whether the plaintiff filed the action without first seeking and receiving an informal inquiry response or advisory opinion from the public access counselor.

At the hearing, parties or members of the general public must be permitted to testify and submit written briefs. A decision to seal all or part of a public record must be based on findings of fact and conclusions of law, showing that the remedial benefits to be gained by effectuating the public policy of the state declared in section 1 of this chapter are outweighed by proof by a preponderance of the evidence by the person seeking the sealing of the record that: 

(1) 
a public interest will be secured by sealing the record; 

(2) 
dissemination of the information contained in the record will create a serious and imminent danger to that public interest;

it is reasonably necessary for the record to remain sealed for 




a period of time. Sealed records shall be unsealed at the earliest possible time after the circumstances necessitating the sealing of the records no longer exist.

IC 5-14-3-9 Denial of disclosure; action to compel disclosure; intervenors; burden of proof; attorney's fees and costs 
Sec. 9. (a) This section does not apply to a request for information under section 4.4 of this chapter. 
(b) A denial of disclosure by a public agency occurs when the person making the request is physically present in the office of the agency, makes the request by telephone, or requests enhanced access to a document and: 
(1) 
the person designated by the public agency as being responsible for public records release decisions refuses to permit inspection and copying of a public record when a request has been made; or 

(2) 
twenty-four (24) hours elapse after any employee of the public agency refuses to permit inspection and copying of a public record when a request has been made; 


whichever occurs first. 
(c) 
If a person requests by mail or by facsimile a copy or copies of a public record, a denial of disclosure does not occur until seven 

(7) 
days have elapsed from the date the public agency receives the request. 

(d) 
If a request is made orally, either in person or by telephone, a public agency may deny the request orally. However, if a request initially is made in writing, by facsimile, or through enhanced access, or if an oral request that has been denied is renewed in writing or by facsimile, a public agency may deny the request if: 

(1) 
the denial is in writing or by facsimile; and 

(2) 
the denial includes: 

(A) 
a statement of the specific exemption or exemptions authorizing the withholding of all or part of the public record; and 

(B) 
the name and the title or position of the person responsible for the denial. 





(e) 
A person who has been denied the right to inspect or copy a public record by a public agency may file an action in the circuit or superior court of the county in which the denial occurred to compel the public agency to permit the person to inspect and copy the public record. Whenever an action is filed under this subsection, the public agency must notify each person who supplied any part of the public record at issue: 

(1) 
that a request for release of the public record has been denied; and 

(2) 
whether the denial was in compliance with an informal inquiry response or advisory opinion of the public access 




counselor. Such persons are entitled to intervene in any litigation that results from the denial. The person who has been denied the right to inspect or copy need not allege or prove any special damage different from that suffered by the public at large. 
(f) 
The court shall determine the matter de novo, with the burden of proof on the public agency to sustain its denial. If the issue in de novo review under this section is whether a public agency properly denied access to a public record because the record is exempted under section 4(a) of this chapter, the public agency meets its burden of proof under this subsection by establishing the content of the record with adequate specificity and not by relying on a conclusory statement or affidavit. 

(g)
 This subsection does not apply to an action under section 5.2 of this chapter. If the issue in a de novo review under this section is whether a public agency properly denied access to a public record because the record is exempted under section 4(b) of this chapter: 

(1) 
the public agency meets its burden of proof under this subsection by: 

(A) 
proving that: 

(i)

(2) 
that instructs the public agency to allow access to the public record; and

(2) 
Not more than five hundred dollars ($500) for each 




additional violation. A civil penalty imposed under this section is in addition to any other civil or criminal penalty imposed. However, in any one (1) action brought under this section, a court may impose only one (1) civil penalty against an individual, even if the court finds that the individual committed multiple violations. This subsection does not preclude a court from imposing another civil penalty against an individual in a separate action, but an individual may not be assessed more than one (1) civil penalty in any one (1) action brought under this section.
