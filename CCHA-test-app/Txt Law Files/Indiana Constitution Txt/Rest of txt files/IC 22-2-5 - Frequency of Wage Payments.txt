The payment shall be made in lawful money of the United States, by negotiable check, draft, or money order, or by electronic transfer to the financial institution designated by the employee. Any contract in violation of this subsection is void. 
(b) Payment shall be made for all wages earned to a date not more than ten (10) business days prior to the date of payment.

(1) ten (10) business days have elapsed after the employee has 
 made a demand for the wages due the employee; or
