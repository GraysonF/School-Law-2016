SUBCHAPTER I—GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 1400. Short title; findings; purposes
(a) Short title
This chapter may be cited as the ‘‘Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act’’.
(b) Omitted
(c) Findings
Congress finds the following:
(1) Disability is a natural part of the human
experience and in no way diminishes the right
of individuals to participate in or contribute
to society. Improving educational results for
children with disabilities is an essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency
for individuals with disabilities.
(2) Before the date of enactment of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of
1975 (Public Law 94–142), the educational needs
of millions of children with disabilities were
not being fully met because—
(A) the children did not receive appropriate educational services;
(B) the children were excluded entirely
from the public school system and from
being educated with their peers;
(C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the
children from having a successful educational experience; or
(D) a lack of adequate resources within the
public school system forced families to find
services outside the public school system.
(3) Since the enactment and implementation
of the Education for All Handicapped Children
Act of 1975, this chapter has been successful in
ensuring children with disabilities and the
families of such children access to a free appropriate public education and in improving
educational results for children with disabilities.
(4) However, the implementation of this
chapter has been impeded by low expectations,
and an insufficient focus on applying
replicable research on proven methods of
teaching and learning for children with disabilities.
(5) Almost 30 years of research and experience has demonstrated that the education of
children with disabilities can be made more effective by—
(A) having high expectations for such children and ensuring their access to the general

Page 850

education curriculum in the regular classroom, to the maximum extent possible, in
order to—
(i) meet developmental goals and, to the
maximum extent possible, the challenging
expectations that have been established
for all children; and
(ii) be prepared to lead productive and
independent adult lives, to the maximum
extent possible;
(B) strengthening the role and responsibility of parents and ensuring that families of
such children have meaningful opportunities
to participate in the education of their children at school and at home;
(C) coordinating this chapter with other
local, educational service agency, State, and
Federal school improvement efforts, including improvement efforts under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 [20
U.S.C. 6301 et seq.], in order to ensure that
such children benefit from such efforts and
that special education can become a service
for such children rather than a place where
such children are sent;
(D) providing appropriate special education and related services, and aids and
supports in the regular classroom, to such
children, whenever appropriate;
(E) supporting high-quality, intensive preservice preparation and professional development for all personnel who work with children with disabilities in order to ensure that
such personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary to improve the academic
achievement and functional performance of
children with disabilities, including the use
of scientifically based instructional practices, to the maximum extent possible;
(F) providing incentives for whole-school
approaches, scientifically based early reading programs, positive behavioral interventions and supports, and early intervening
services to reduce the need to label children
as disabled in order to address the learning
and behavioral needs of such children;
(G) focusing resources on teaching and
learning while reducing paperwork and requirements that do not assist in improving
educational results; and
(H) supporting the development and use of
technology, including assistive technology
devices and assistive technology services, to
maximize accessibility for children with disabilities.
(6) While States, local educational agencies,
and educational service agencies are primarily
responsible for providing an education for all
children with disabilities, it is in the national
interest that the Federal Government have a
supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to educate children with disabilities in
order to improve results for such children and
to ensure equal protection of the law.
(7) A more equitable allocation of resources
is essential for the Federal Government to
meet its responsibility to provide an equal
educational opportunity for all individuals.
(8) Parents and schools should be given expanded opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and constructive ways.

Page 851

§ 1400

TITLE 20—EDUCATION

(9) Teachers, schools, local educational agencies, and States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary paperwork burdens that
do not lead to improved educational outcomes.
(10)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the growing needs of an increasingly diverse society.
(B) America’s ethnic profile is rapidly
changing. In 2000, 1 of every 3 persons in the
United States was a member of a minority
group or was limited English proficient.
(C) Minority children comprise an increasing
percentage of public school students.
(D) With such changing demographics, recruitment efforts for special education personnel should focus on increasing the participation of minorities in the teaching profession in
order to provide appropriate role models with
sufficient knowledge to address the special
education needs of these students.
(11)(A) The limited English proficient population is the fastest growing in our Nation,
and the growth is occurring in many parts of
our Nation.
(B) Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the levels of referral and placement of limited English proficient children in
special education.
(C) Such discrepancies pose a special challenge for special education in the referral of,
assessment of, and provision of services for,
our Nation’s students from non-English language backgrounds.
(12)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent
the intensification of problems connected with
mislabeling and high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.
(B) More minority children continue to be
served in special education than would be expected from the percentage of minority students in the general school population.
(C) African-American children are identified
as having intellectual disabilities and emotional disturbance at rates greater than their
White counterparts.
(D) In the 1998–1999 school year, AfricanAmerican children represented just 14.8 percent of the population aged 6 through 21, but
comprised 20.2 percent of all children with disabilities.
(E) Studies have found that schools with predominately White students and teachers have
placed disproportionately high numbers of
their minority students into special education.
(13)(A) As the number of minority students
in special education increases, the number of
minority teachers and related services personnel produced in colleges and universities continues to decrease.
(B) The opportunity for full participation by
minority individuals, minority organizations,
and Historically Black Colleges and Universities in awards for grants and contracts,
boards of organizations receiving assistance
under this chapter, peer review panels, and
training of professionals in the area of special
education is essential to obtain greater success in the education of minority children
with disabilities.
(14) As the graduation rates for children
with disabilities continue to climb, providing

effective transition services to promote successful post-school employment or education
is an important measure of accountability for
children with disabilities.
(d) Purposes
The purposes of this chapter are—
(1)(A) to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education that emphasizes special education and related services designed to
meet their unique needs and prepare them for
further education, employment, and independent living;
(B) to ensure that the rights of children with
disabilities and parents of such children are
protected; and
(C) to assist States, localities, educational
service agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education of all children with disabilities;
(2) to assist States in the implementation of
a statewide, comprehensive, coordinated,
multidisciplinary, interagency system of early
intervention services for infants and toddlers
with disabilities and their families;
(3) to ensure that educators and parents
have the necessary tools to improve educational results for children with disabilities
by supporting system improvement activities;
coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and technology development and media services; and
(4) to assess, and ensure the effectiveness of,
efforts to educate children with disabilities.
