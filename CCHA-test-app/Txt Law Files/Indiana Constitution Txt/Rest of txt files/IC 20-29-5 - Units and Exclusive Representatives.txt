The parties may agree on the appropriate unit. For this purpose, the parties consist of the school employer and a school employee organization representing at least twenty percent (20%) of the school employees in a proposed unit. 

(c) 
If the parties do not reach an agreement on the appropriate unit, or if a school employee in the proposed unit files a complaint about the unit with the board, the board shall determine the proper unit after a hearing. The board's decision must be based on but not limited to the following considerations: 

(1) 
Efficient administration of school operations.

(1) 
another school employee organization representing twenty percent (20%) of the school employees within the unit files written objections to the recognition; or 

(2) 
a school employee files a complaint to the composition of the unit with the school employer or the board within the notice period set forth in this section.

(e) 
The board shall investigate a petition filed under subsection (b), (c), or (d). If the board has reasonable cause to believe that a question exists as to whether the designated exclusive representative or any school employee organization represents a majority of the school employees in a unit, the board shall provide for an appropriate hearing within thirty (30) days. In holding a hearing, the board is not required to comply with IC 4-21.5.

IC 20-29-5-7 Teacher members on committees 
Sec. 7. (a) This section does not apply to the bargaining team for the exclusive representative. 
(b) 
The percentage of teacher positions the exclusive representative may appoint to serve on a statutory or locally created district wide committee may not exceed the percentage of teachers 

in the school corporation who are members of the exclusive representative. If multiplying the number of teacher positions on the committee by the percentage of teachers in the school corporation who are members of the exclusive representative does not produce a whole number, the product must be rounded up to the nearest whole number. The percentage of positions applies to the number of teacher positions on a committee and not to the total number of positions on a committee. 

(c) 
The percentage of teacher positions the exclusive representative may appoint to serve on a statutory or locally created school wide committee may not exceed the percentage of teachers in the school who are members of the exclusive representative. If multiplying the number of teacher positions on the committee by the percentage of teachers in the school who are members of the exclusive representative does not produce a whole number, the product must be rounded up to the nearest whole number. The percentage of positions applies to the number of teacher positions on a committee and not to the total number of positions on a committee. 

(d) 
A committee to which this section applies may not address subjects of bargaining under this article. A school employer's appointment of a teacher to a committee is not an unfair practice as it relates to the appointment of the teacher committee members. 


(e) By September 15 of each school year, the local president or other officer or designee of the exclusive representative shall certify by affidavit to the school employer the number of teachers in each school and in the entire school corporation who are members of the exclusive representative.
