35 IAC 14-2-16 Actuarial rule Authority: IC 5-10.4 Affected: IC 5-10.4 Sec. 16. Two (2) forms of benefit payments are considered to be actuarially equivalent if the expected present value of future payments are the same. For TRF, the expected present value of the pension portion of the benefit is calculated based on six and seventy-five hundredths percent (6.75%) interest rate and the 2013 Static Mortality table for males and females, projected five (5) years using Scale AA, and weighted 50/50. The expected present value of the annuity portion of the benefit is calculated using the 2013 Static Mortality table for males and females, projected five (5) years using Scale AA, and weighted 50/50 and prior to January 1, 2017, and after October 1, 2015, an interest rate equal to the greater of similar annuities in the private market or four and one­half percent (4.5%). After January 1, 2017, the interest rate used will be equal to similar annuities in the private market.

35 IAC 14-2-17 ASA and RSA annuity interest Authority: IC 5-10.2-2-1; IC 5-10.2-2-3; IC 5-10.5-4-2 Affected: IC 5-10.2-3; IC 5-10.2-4; IC 5-10.5-4-2.6 Sec. 17. (a) Whenever a member elects to annuitize the member's ASA or RSA, the annuitized interest rate will be applied beginning with the date of the distribution of the annuity and the annuity will be calculated prospectively from that date regardless whether the distribution was deferred under IC 5-10.2-4-2(c), there is a retroactive disabilitypayment under IC 5-10.2-4-6, or there is a retroactive benefit payment under IC 5-10.2-4-8.2. 
(b) 

The annuity interest rate is determined by IC 5-10.5-4-2.6 and this rule. Except for as set forth in subsection (c), the 
annuity interest rate that will be applied is the rate in effect as of the retirement date as determined under IC 5-10.2-4­1.3, the disability retirement date, or the member's retirement date due to election made under IC 5-10.2-4-8.2. 

(c) 

Except as provided in IC 5-10.5-4-2.6, when a member elects to defer receiving, in any form, the member's annuity 
savings account under IC 5-10.2-4-2(c), the annuity interest rate that will be applied is the rate in effect as of the date 
INPRS receives the member's postretirement payment of ASA election form. 

(d) 

When a member electstochangetheir survivor beneficiaryor pension option, or both, under IC 5-10.2-4-7.2, theannuity 
interest rate that will be applied is the rate in effect as of the date INPRS receives the member's election form. 

(e) 

For example, Julia is a seventy-five (75) year old active member with twenty-five (25) years of creditable service. She 
makes an election under IC 5-10.2-4-8.2 to begin receiving benefits relating back to the date she was first eligible to 
make the election (five (5) years ago). Julia elects to annuitize her ASA. The annuity is calculated and interest rate is 
the rate in effect on the retirement date Julia selects. Julia will receive five (5) years of retroactive pension benefits 
using only twenty (20) years of service credit in the pension calculation. Because Julia's ASA account was actively 
earning interest, gains, or losses during the five 

(5) 

year period before Julia made the election, and the ASA had not been annuitized during this period, the annuitized 
interest rate will be applied beginning with the actual date of distribution of the annuity. (Board of Trustees of the

(a) Except as provided under IC 5-10.2-3-6.5, a member is not entitled to receive benefits after membership is suspended and the amount held in the annuity savings account withdrawn unless the member returns to covered employment in Indiana and remains employed long enough to earn at least one-half (1/2) year of service credit. However, if member shows to the satisfaction of the fund that there was bona fide intent to return to employment and comply with this rule and the employee was capable of performing such employment, but was prevented from working for the requisite period due to illness, injury, death of the employee, or other reason, which occurred subsequent to the date of the reemployment, then such reemployment period requirement may be waived. Time spent on an employer approved leave of absence granted under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or pursuant to a leave granted under IC 5-10.4 taken during the reemployment period shall be used in determining whether the person met the requirements of this section provided that the member returned to covered employment immediately after termination of such leave. 

(b) 
Should the fund become aware that a member has reemployed in a covered position within thirty (30) days after having requested the withdrawal and if no withdrawal distribution has been made, the fund will not make the withdrawal distribution and the suspension of membership shall be automatically deferred and the member shall not be eligible for such refund.

35 IAC 14-4-4 Member designation of beneficiaries Authority: IC 5-10.4; IC 5-10.5-4-2 Affected: IC 5-10.2-3-7.5; IC 5-10.2-3-10; IC 5-10.4-4-10 Sec. 4. (a) A new member shall designate, by name, primary and secondary beneficiaries to receive the assets present in the annuity savings account equally or designated by whole percentage increments on the occasion of the member's death prior to retirement, less any disability benefits paid. 
(b) 
A member who establishes a rollover account pursuant to IC 5-10.2-3-10 may designate a beneficiary or 
beneficiaries separate from those designated on the member's annuity savings account under the requirements as stated 
herein. 
(c)Amember maynamemorethan one(1)individualasprimaryor contingentbeneficiariesofthemember'sannuitysavings

form. Alternative beneficiary designations, such as per stirpes or by representation, will not be accepted or recognized 
by the fund. If a member has designated more than one (1) primary beneficiary, and one (1) or more of the primary 
beneficiaries predecease the member and themember doesnot completeanewbeneficiarydesignation 
form,theremainingprimarybeneficiarieswillreceivean apportioned pro rata share based on the remaining primary 
beneficiaries' allocated percentages of the deceased primary beneficiary or beneficiaries portion. For example, member 
X designates three (3) primary beneficiaries as follows: Ann 60%, Bob 30%, and Carl 10%. Ann predeceases member 
X, and member X does not submit a new beneficiary designation form. Member X had $10,000 in her annuity savings 
account (ASA) at the time of her death. Ann's 60% share will be divided between Bob and Carl as follows: Bob $4,500 
and Carl $1,500. Therefore, the total amount that Bob will receive from member X's ASA is $7,500, and the total 
amount that Carl will receive from member X's ASA is $2,500. 


(d) 

A member may name a trust, the member's estate, or other legal entity as the beneficiary of the member's annuity 
savings account or rollover account. 

(e) 

The designated beneficiary's right to a benefit vests upon the death of the member in the designated beneficiary on file 
with the fund. A change of beneficiary designation must be made in a manner and form approved by the board and 
must be filed with the fund before the time of death of the member. A change of beneficiary designation received after 
the estate [sic] time of death of the member is not valid. A written beneficiary designation for the ASA or RSA must 
be witnessed by an individual other than the member's designated beneficiary. Timely electronic beneficiary 
designations submitted through the fund's website in a form and manner approved by the board shall be deemed to 
have met the requirements of this rule. (Board of Trustees of the Indiana Public Retirement System; 35 IAC 14-4-4;

This option increases the monthly pension benefit amount for which the member would ordinarily be eligible from the date of retirement until sixty-two (62) years of age. When the member reaches sixty-two (62) years of age, the member's monthly pension benefit will be reduced. Depending upon the factors used in the calculation, the member's monthly pension benefit may be reduced to zero (0). Such reduction will occur whether or not the member applies for Social Security Administration benefits.
