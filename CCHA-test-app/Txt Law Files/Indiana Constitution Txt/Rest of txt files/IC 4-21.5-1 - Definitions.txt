(A) 
describes the subject of the order with reasonable particularity; and

is delivered to the agency at least seven (7) days before the day that notice is given under this section. 



(5) 
Each person who has a substantial and direct proprietary interest in the subject of the order. 

(6) 
Each person whose absence as a party in the proceeding concerning the order would deny another party complete relief in the proceeding or who claims an interest related to the subject of the order and is so situated that the disposition of the matter, in the person's absence, may: 

(A) 
as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest; or 

(B) 
leave any other person who is a party to a proceeding concerning the order subject to a substantial risk of incurring multiple or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the person's claimed interest. 




A person who is entitled to notice under this subsection is not a party to any proceeding resulting from the grant of a petition for review under section 7 of this chapter unless the person is designated as a party in the record of the proceeding.

(1) 
A brief description of the order.

preliminary hearing;

An agency shall make a good faith effort to identify and notify these persons, and the agency has the burden of persuasion that it has done so. The agency may request that the applicant for the order assist in the identification of these persons. Failure to notify any of these persons is not grounds for invalidating an order, unless an unnotified person is substantially prejudiced by the lack of notice. The burden of persuasion as to substantial prejudice is on the unnotified person. 

(g) 
If a timely and sufficient application has been made for renewal of a license with reference to any activity of a continuing nature and review is granted under section 7 of this chapter, the existing license does not expire until the agency has disposed of a proceeding under this chapter concerning the renewal, unless a statute other than this article provides otherwise.

(h) 
On the motion of any party or other person having a pending petition for intervention in the proceeding, an administrative law judge shall, as soon as practicable, conduct a preliminary hearing to determine whether the order should be stayed. The burden of proof in the preliminary hearing is on the person seeking the stay. The administrative law judge may stay the order in whole or in part. The order concerning the stay may be issued before or after the order described in subsection (a) becomes effective. The resulting order concerning the stay shall be served on the parties, any person who has a pending petition for intervention in the proceeding, and any person who has requested notice under subsection (d). It must include a statement of the facts and law on which it is based.

(1) 
the court finds that the petition for review and the petition for a stay order show a reasonable probability that the order or determination appealed from is invalid or illegal; and 

(2) 
a bond is filed that is conditioned upon the due prosecution of the proceeding for review and that the petitioner will pay all court costs and abide by the order of the agency if it is not set aside.

(1) Improper constitution as a decision-making body or grounds for disqualification of those taking the agency action. 
(2)

(b) 
The court may remand a matter to the agency before final disposition of a petition for review with directions that the agency conduct further factfinding or that the agency prepare an adequate record, if: 

(1)

(b)

(c) 
Upon a written request by the petitioner, the agency taking the action being reviewed shall prepare the agency record for the petitioner. If part of the record has been preserved without a transcript, the agency shall prepare a transcript for inclusion in the record transmitted to the court, except for portions that the parties to the judicial review proceeding stipulate to omit in accordance with subsection (e).

Notwithstanding IC 5-14-3-8, the agency shall charge the petitioner with the reasonable cost of preparing any necessary copies and transcripts for transmittal to the court, unless a person files with the court, under oath and in writing, the statement described by IC 33-37-3-2. 

(e) 
By stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings, the record may be shortened, summarized, or organized. 

(f) 
The court may tax the cost of preparing transcripts and copies for the record: 

(1) 
against a party to the judicial review proceeding who unreasonably refuses to stipulate to shorten, summarize, or organize the record; or 

(2) 
in accordance with the rules governing civil actions in the courts or other law. 




(g) Additions to the record concerning evidence received under section 12 of this chapter must be made as ordered by the court.
