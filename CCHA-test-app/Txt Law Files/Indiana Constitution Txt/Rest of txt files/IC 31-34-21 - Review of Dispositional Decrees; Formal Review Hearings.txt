(5) 
consider and approve a permanency plan for the child that complies with the requirements set forth in section 7.5 of this chapter;

(4) 
Ask the child about the desired permanency outcome for the child and document the child's response.

The state may rebut the presumption and show that jurisdiction should continue by proving that the objectives of the dispositional decree have not been accomplished, that a 


continuation of the decree with or without any modifications is necessary, and that it is in the child's best interests for the court to maintain its jurisdiction over the child. If the department does not sustain its burden for continued jurisdiction, the court shall: 
(1) 
direct the department to establish a permanency plan within thirty (30) days; or 

(2) 
discharge the child and the child's parent, guardian, or 


custodian. The court may retain jurisdiction to the extent necessary to carry out any orders under subdivision (1). As added by P.L.1-1997, SEC.17.
