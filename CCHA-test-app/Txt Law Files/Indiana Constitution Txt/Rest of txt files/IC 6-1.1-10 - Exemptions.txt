Sec. 1. (a) The property of the United States and its agencies and instrumentalities is exempt from property taxation to the extent that this state is prohibited by law from taxing it.

(b) If the United States provides for the payment of money in lieu of property taxes upon tangible property which is exempt from taxation, the payment shall be made to and settled by the department of local government finance. The department of local government finance may make appraisements, assessments, and agreements and may do all acts necessary to the ascertainment, settlement, and collection of such a payment. The department of local government finance may distribute amounts so received to the taxing units that would be entitled to the money if the payment were for taxes upon the property. However, if the payment is made by the United States for the rendition of a particular service, the department of local government finance shall distribute the payment to the taxing unit which rendered the service. Where payment is made for a service, the department of local government finance may not make a settlement with the United States without the prior approval of the taxing unit involved.

The appeal must be filed on or before the deadline for filing an exemption under section 16 of this chapter. If the county assessor finds that the property owner's appeal substantiates that the property owner's normal enrollment count is not accurately represented by using the required date, the assessor shall establish an alternate date to be used for that year that represents the property owner's normal enrollment count for that year.
