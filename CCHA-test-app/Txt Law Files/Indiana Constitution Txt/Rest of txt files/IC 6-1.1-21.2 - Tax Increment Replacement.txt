Impose a special assessment on the owners of property that is located in an allocation area to raise an amount not to exceed the tax increment replacement amount.

revenues in the allocation area by an amount that does not exceed the tax increment replacement amount. 
(c) 
The governing body shall submit a proposed special assessment or tax levy under this section to the legislative body of the unit that established the district. The legislative body may:

(d) 
Before a public hearing under subsection (b) may be held, the governing body must publish notice of the hearing under IC 5-3-1. The notice must also be sent to the fiscal officer of each political subdivision that is located in any part of the district. The notice must state that the governing body will meet to consider whether a special assessment or tax should be imposed under this chapter and whether the special assessment or tax will help the governing body realize the redevelopment or economic development objectives for the allocation area or honor its obligations related to the allocation area. The notice must also specify a date when the governing body will receive and hear remonstrances and objections from persons affected by the special assessment. All persons affected by the hearing, including all taxpayers within the allocation area, shall be considered notified of the pendency of the hearing and of subsequent acts, hearings, and orders of the governing body by the notice. At the hearing, which may be adjourned from time to time, the governing body shall hear all persons affected by the proceedings and shall consider all written remonstrances and objections that have been filed. The only grounds for remonstrance or objection are that the special assessment or tax will not help the governing body realize the redevelopment or economic development objectives for the allocation area or honor its obligations related to the allocation area. After considering the evidence presented, the governing body shall take final action concerning the proposed special assessment or tax. The final action taken by the governing body shall be recorded and is final and conclusive, except that an appeal may be taken in the manner prescribed by subsection (e). 

(e) 
A person who filed a written remonstrance with a governing body under subsection (d) and is aggrieved by the final action taken may, within ten (10) days after that final action, file in the office of the clerk of the circuit or superior court a copy of the order of the governing body and the person's remonstrance or objection against that final action, together with a bond conditioned to pay the costs of appeal if the appeal is determined against the person. The only ground of remonstrance or objection that the court may hear is whether the proposed special assessment or tax will help achieve the redevelopment of economic development objectives for the 


allocation area or honor its obligations related to the allocation area. An appeal under this subsection shall be promptly heard by the court without a jury. All remonstrances or objections upon which an appeal has been taken must be consolidated, heard, and determined within thirty (30) days after the time of the filing of the appeal. The court shall hear evidence on the remonstrances or objections and may confirm the final action of the governing body or sustain the remonstrances or objections. The judgment of the court is final and conclusive, unless an appeal is taken as in other civil actions. 
(f) This section applies to a governing body that: 
(1) 
is the metropolitan development commission for a county having a consolidated city; and 

(2) 
has established an allocation area and pledged tax increment revenues from the area to the payment of bonds, leases, or other obligations before May 8, 1989. 


Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e), the governing body may determine to fund that part of the tax increment replacement amount attributable to the repeal of IC 36-7-15.1-26.5, IC 36-7-15.1-26.7, and IC 36-7-15.1-26.9 from property taxes on personal property (as defined in IC 6-1.1-1-11). If the governing body makes such a determination, the property taxes on personal property in the amount determined under this subsection shall be allocated to the redevelopment district, paid into the special fund for the allocation area, and used for the purposes specified in IC 36-7-15.1-26.
