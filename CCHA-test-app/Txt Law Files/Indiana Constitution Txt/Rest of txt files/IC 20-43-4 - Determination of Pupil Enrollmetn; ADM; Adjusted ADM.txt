IC 20-43-4-2 Version a Determination of ADM; adjustments; estimates 
Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following version of this section, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 2. (a) A school corporation's ADM is the number of eligible pupils enrolled in: 
(1) the school corporation; or 
(2) 
a transferee corporation; on the days fixed in September and in February by the state board for a count of students under section 3 of this chapter and as subsequently adjusted not later than the date specified under the rules adopted by the state board. The state board may adjust the school's count of eligible pupils if the state board determines that the count is unrepresentative of the school corporation's enrollment. In addition, a school corporation may petition the state board to make an adjusted count of students enrolled in the school corporation if the corporation has reason to believe that the count is unrepresentative of the school corporation's enrollment. 

(b) 
Each school corporation shall in June of 2013 and in May of each year thereafter provide to the department an estimate of the school corporation's ADM that will result from the count of eligible pupils in the following September. The department may update and adjust the estimate as determined appropriate by the department. 


(c) A new charter school shall submit an enrollment estimate to the department before April 1 of the year the new charter school will be open for enrollment. The department shall use the new charter school's enrollment estimate as the basis for the new charter school's distribution beginning in July and until actual ADM is available, subject to section 9 of this chapter. However, if the new charter school's enrollment estimate is greater than eighty percent (80%) of the new charter school's authorized enrollment cap, the department may use that enrollment estimate if the department has requested and reviewed other enrollment data that support that enrollment estimate. However, if the enrollment data requested and reviewed by the department does not support the enrollment estimate submitted by the new charter school, the department shall determine the estimated ADM based on the enrollment data requested and reviewed by the department.

one (1) pupil, if the pupil is enrolled in a full-day kindergarten program; or 

(2)

IC 20-43-4-6 Determination; full-time equivalency basis 
Sec. 6. (a) In determining ADM, each pupil enrolled in a public school, including a charter school, and a nonpublic school is to be counted on a full-time equivalency basis if the pupil: 
(1) 
is enrolled in a public school and a nonpublic school; 

(2) 
has legal settlement in a school corporation; and 

(3) 
receives instructional services from the school corporation. 


(b) For purposes of this section, full-time equivalency is 
calculated as follows: STEP ONE: Determine the result of: 
(A) the number of days instructional services will be provided to the pupil, not to exceed one hundred eighty (180); divided by 
(B) one hundred eighty (180). 
STEP TWO: Determine the result of: 

(A) 
the pupil's public school instructional time (as defined in IC 20-30-2-1); divided by 

(B) 
the actual public school regular instructional day (as 


defined in IC 20-30-2-2). 
STEP THREE: Determine the result of: 

(A) the STEP ONE result; multiplied by 
(B) the STEP TWO result. STEP FOUR: Determine the lesser of one (1) or the result of: 
(A) the STEP THREE result; multiplied by 
(B) one and five hundredths (1.05). However, the state board may, by rules adopted under IC 4-22-2, specify an equivalent formula if the state board determines that the equivalent formula would more accurately reflect the instructional services provided by a school corporation during a period that a particular ADM count is in effect for the school corporation.

IC 20-43-4-9 Version a Calculation of state tuition support distributions based on current ADM; adjusted ADM counts; payment reconciliation 
Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following version of this section, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 9. (a) Subject to subsection (b), this subsection applies to the calculation of state tuition support distributions that are based on the current ADM of a school corporation. The fall count of ADM, as adjusted by the state board under section 2 of this chapter, shall be used to compute state tuition support distributions made in the first six (6) months of the current state fiscal year, and the spring count of ADM, as adjusted by the state board under section 2 of this chapter, shall be used to compute state tuition support distributions made in the second six (6) months of the state fiscal year. 
(b) If the state board adjusts a count of ADM after a distribution is made under this article, the adjusted count retroactively applies to the amount of state tuition support distributed to a school corporation affected by the adjusted count. The department shall settle any overpayment or underpayment of state tuition support resulting from an adjusted count of ADM on the schedule determined by the department and approved by the budget agency. As added by P.L.205-2013, SEC.280. Amended by P.L.213-2015, SEC.215. 

IC 20-43-4-9 Version b Calculation of state tuition support distributions based on current ADM; adjusted ADM counts; payment reconciliation 
Note: This version of section effective 1-1-2017. See also preceding version of this section, effective until 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 9. (a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c), this subsection applies to the calculation of state tuition support distributions that are based on the current ADM of a school corporation. The fall count of ADM, as adjusted by the state board under section 2 of this chapter, shall be used to compute state tuition support distributions made in the first six (6) months of the current state fiscal year, and the spring count of ADM, as adjusted by the state board under section 2 of this chapter, shall be used to compute state tuition support distributions made in the second six (6) months of the state fiscal year. 
(b) This subsection applies to a school corporation that does not provide the estimates required by section 2(b)(2) of this chapter before the deadline. For monthly state tuition support distributions made before the fall count of ADM is finalized, the department shall determine the distribution amount for such a school corporation for a state fiscal year of the biennium, using data that were used by the general assembly in determining the state tuition support appropriation for the budget act for that state fiscal year. The department may adjust the data used under this subsection for errors. 
(c) If the state board adjusts a count of ADM after a distribution is made under this article, the adjusted count retroactively applies to the amount of state tuition support distributed to a school corporation affected by the adjusted count. The department shall settle any overpayment or underpayment of state tuition support resulting from an adjusted count of ADM on the schedule determined by the department and approved by the budget agency. As added by P.L.205-2013, SEC.280. Amended by P.L.213-2015, SEC.215; P.L.151-2016, SEC.4.
