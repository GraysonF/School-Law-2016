A contract with a teacher may be canceled immediately in the manner set forth in sections 2 through 4 of this chapter for any of the following reasons:

(2) 
Insubordination, which means a willful refusal to obey the state school laws or reasonable rules adopted for the governance of the school building or the school corporation. 

(3) 
Incompetence, including: 

(A) 
for probationary teachers, receiving an ineffective designation on a performance evaluation or receiving two (2) consecutive improvement necessary ratings on a performance evaluation under IC 20-28-11.5; or 

(B) 
for any teacher, receiving an ineffective designation on two (2) consecutive performance evaluations or an ineffective designation or improvement necessary rating under IC 20-28-11.5 for three (3) years of any five (5) year period. 



(4) 
Neglect of duty.

In addition to the reasons set forth in subsection (b), a probationary teacher's contract may be canceled for any reason relevant to the school corporation's interest in the manner set forth in sections 2 through 4 of this chapter. 

(d) 
After June 30, 2012, the cancellation of teacher's contracts due to a justifiable decrease in the number of teaching positions shall be determined on the basis of performance rather than seniority.

(e) 
Only the governing body may terminate, cancel, or otherwise refuse to renew a contract of a superintendent or assistant superintendent. Notice of the contract cancellation or the refusal to renew the individual's contract must be provided in the manner provided in IC 20-28-8-3(a).

IC 20-28-7.5-2 Procedure for cancellation 
Sec. 2. (a) Before a teacher's contract is canceled, the teacher has the following rights: 
(1) 
The principal shall notify the teacher of the principal's preliminary decision. The notification must be: 

(A) 
in writing; and 

(B) 
delivered in person or mailed by registered or certified mail to the teacher at the teacher's last known address. 



(2) 
The notice in subdivision (1) must include a written statement, subject to IC 5-14-3-4, giving the reasons for the preliminary decision. 

(3) 
Notification due to a reduction in force must be delivered between May 1 and July 1. 


(b) 
For a cancellation of a teacher's contract for a reason other than a reduction in force, the notice required under subsection (a)(1) must inform the teacher that, not later than five (5) days after the teacher's receipt of the notice, the teacher may request a private conference with the superintendent or the assistant superintendent. The superintendent or the assistant superintendent, as applicable, must set the requested meeting not later than ten (10) days after the request. 

(c) 
At the conference between the superintendent or the assistant superintendent, as applicable, and the teacher, the teacher may be accompanied by a representative. 

(d) 
After the conference between the superintendent or the assistant superintendent, as applicable, and the teacher, the superintendent or the assistant superintendent, whoever attended the conference, shall make a written recommendation to the governing body of the school corporation regarding the cancellation of the teacher's contract. 

(e)
 If the teacher does not request a conference under subsection (b), the principal's preliminary decision is considered final. 

(f) 
If a probationary, professional, or established teacher files a request with the governing body for an additional private conference not later than five (5) days after the initial private conference with the superintendent or the assistant superintendent, as applicable, the teacher is entitled to an additional private conference with the governing body before the governing body makes a final decision. The final decision must be in writing and must be made not more than thirty (30) days after the governing body receives the teacher's request for the additional private conference. At the private conference the governing body shall do the following: 

(1) 
Allow the teacher to present evidence to refute the reason or reasons for contract cancellation and supporting evidence provided by the school corporation. Any evidence presented at the private conference must have been exchanged by the parties at least seven (7) days before the private conference. 

(2) 
Consider whether a preponderance of the evidence supports the cancellation of the teacher's contract.

(b) 
A contract between a school corporation and a teacher is void if the teacher, at the time of signing the contract, is bound by a previous contract to teach in a public school and the contract is entered into at any time during the school year or less than fourteen 

(14) 
days before the day on which the teacher must report for work at that school. However, another contract may be signed by the teacher that will be effective if the teacher: 

(1) 
furnishes the principal a release by the first employer; or 

(2) 
shows proof that thirty (30) days written notice was delivered by the teacher to the first employer. 




(c) A principal may request from a teacher, at the time of contracting, a written statement as to whether the teacher has signed another teaching contract. However, the teacher's failure to provide the statement is not a cause for subsequently voiding the contract. As added by P.L.90-2011, SEC.31.
