IC 20-31-8-2 Secondary means of assessing performance 
Sec. 2. (a) In addition to scores on the ISTEP program test and other assessments, the department shall use the performance indicators developed by the state board and the benchmarks and indicators of performance in each school corporation's annual performance report as a secondary means of assessing the performance of each school and school corporation. 
(b) The department shall assess school performance in the following manner: 
(1) 
Compare the academic performance and growth of the individual students in each school and each school corporation with the prior academic performance and growth of the individual students in the school or school corporation and not to the performance of other schools or school corporations. 

(2) 
Compare the results in the annual report under IC 20-20-8 with the benchmarks and indicators of performance established in the plan for the same school. 

(3) 
Compare the results for a school by comparing each student's results for each grade with the student's prior year results, with an adjustment for student mobility rate. 

(4) 
Compare the results for a school with the state average and the ninety-fifth percentile level for all assessments and performance indicators.

IC 20-31-8-3 Establishment of categories of performance 
Sec. 3. (a) The state board shall establish a number of categories, using an "A" through "F" grading scale, to designate performance based on the individual student academic performance and growth to proficiency in each school. 
(b) The state board, in consultation with the department, shall define "low population schools" and shall determine the criteria for placing low population schools in categories established under subsection (a). In setting the definition and criteria for low population schools, the state board shall not penalize schools based on population. An eligible school (as defined in IC 20-51-1-4.7) may not be penalized under IC 20-51-4-9 for the sole reason that the eligible school is considered a low population school under this subsection. The state board's definition and criteria may include the placement of a school that fits the state board's definition in a "null" or "no letter grade" category. 
(c) In developing metrics for the categories established under subsection (a), the state board, in consultation with the department, to the extent not inconsistent with federal law, shall consider the severity of tested students' disabilities when using ISTEP scores as a means of assessing school performance.

(b) The state board may place a school in a category or designation of school performance only if: 
(1) 
the department has provided each school the opportunity to review, add to, or supplement the data, and to correct any errors 

in the data; and 

(2) 
the state board's staff has had an opportunity to review and analyze the school corporation, school, and student level data. 


(c) The state board may obtain assistance from another entity or, with the approval of the legislative council, the legislative services agency, to ensure the validity and reliability of the performance category or designation placements calculated by the department under section 2 of this chapter.
