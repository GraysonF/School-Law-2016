(B) 
Property taxes imposed by a political subdivision to pay for debt service obligations of a political subdivision that are not exempted from the application of a credit granted under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter by section 7(b), 7(c), 7.5(b), or 7.5(c) of this chapter or any other law. Property taxes described in this subsection are subject to the credit granted under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter by section 7(b), 7(c), 7.5(b), or 7.5(c) of this chapter regardless of their designation as protected taxes. 



(3) 
"Unprotected taxes" refers to property taxes that are not protected taxes. 


(c) Except as provided in subsection (e) for property taxes due and payable in 2013, the total amount of revenue to be distributed to the fund for which the protected taxes were imposed shall be determined as if no credit were granted under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter. The total amount of the loss in revenue resulting from the granting of credits under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter must reduce only the amount of unprotected taxes distributed to a fund using the following criteria: 
(1) 
The reduction may be allocated in the amounts determined by the political subdivision using a combination of unprotected taxes of the political subdivision in those taxing districts in which the credit caused a reduction in protected taxes. 

(2) 
The tax revenue and each fund of any other political subdivisions must not be affected by the reduction. 


(d) When: 
(1) 
the revenue that otherwise would be distributed to a fund receiving only unprotected taxes is reduced entirely under subsection (c) and the remaining revenue is insufficient for a fund receiving protected taxes to receive the revenue specified by subsection (c); or 

(2) 
there is not a fund receiving only unprotected taxes from 


which to distribute revenue; the revenue distributed to the fund receiving protected taxes must also be reduced. If the revenue distributed to a fund receiving protected taxes is reduced, the political subdivision may transfer money from one (1) or more of the other funds of the political subdivision to offset the loss in revenue to the fund receiving protected taxes. The transfer is limited to the amount necessary for the fund receiving protected taxes to receive the revenue specified under subsection (c). The amount transferred shall be specifically identified as a debt service obligation transfer for each affected fund. 
(e) This subsection applies to property taxes due and payable in 2013. The total amount of the loss in revenue resulting from the granting of credits under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter must reduce the amount of protected and unprotected property taxes distributed to a fund in proportion to the property tax levy imposed for that fund relative to the total of all protected and unprotected property tax levies imposed by the political subdivision. The allocations shall be made after the political subdivision receives its distribution. As added by P.L.172-2011, SEC.42. Amended by P.L.137-2012, SEC.35; P.L.257-2013, SEC.29.

the school corporation is not eligible to allocate credits proportionately under this section. 
(b) Subject to subsection (a), a school corporation is eligible to allocate credits proportionately under this section for 2016, 2017, or 2018 if the school corporation's percentage computed under this subsection is at least ten percent (10%) for its transportation fund levy for that year, as certified by the department of local government finance.

(1) 
Compute the amount of credits granted under this chapter against the school corporation's levyfor the school corporation's transportation fund. 

(2) 
Compute the school corporation's levy for the school corporation's transportation fund. 

(3) 
Divide the amount computed under subdivision (1) by the amount computed under subdivision (2) and express it as a percentage. 


The computation must be made by taking into account the requirements of section 9.8 of this chapter regarding protected taxes and the impact of credits granted under this chapter on the revenue to be distributed to the school corporation's transportation fund for the particular year. 
(c) 
A school corporation that desires to be an eligible school corporation under this section must, before May 1 of the year for which it wants a determination, submit a written request for a certification by the department of local government finance that the computation of the school corporation's percentage under subsection 

(b) 
is correct. The department of local government finance shall, not later than June 1 of that year, determine whether the percentage computed by the school corporation is accurate and certify whether the school corporation is eligible under this section. 


(d) For a school corporation that is certified as eligible under this section, the school corporation may allocate the effect of the credits granted under this chapter proportionately among all the school corporation's property tax funds that are not exempt under section 7.5(b) or 7.5(c) of this chapter, based on the levy for each fund and without taking into account the requirements of section 9.8 of this chapter regarding protected taxes.
