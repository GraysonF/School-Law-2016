If the department:

Subject to the provisions of all applicable statutes, and notwithstanding IC 6-1.1-18-1, the department of local government finance shall, unless the department finds extenuating circumstances, increase a political subdivision's tax levy to an amount that exceeds 


the amount originally advertised or adopted by the political subdivision if: 
(1) 
the increase is requested in writing by the officers of the political subdivision; 

(2) 
the requested increase is published on the department's advertising Internet web site and (before January 1, 2015) is published by the political subdivision according to a notice provided by the department; and 

(3) 
notice is given to the county fiscal body of the error and the 


department's correction. If the department increases a levy beyond what was advertised or adopted under this subsection, it shall, unless the department finds extenuating circumstances, reduce the certified levy affected below the maximum allowable levy by the lesser of five percent (5%) of the difference between the advertised or adopted levy and the increased levy, or one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000).

(b) 
For a fund of a political subdivision subject to levy limits under IC 6-1.1-18.5-3, the department of local government finance shall calculate and certify the allowable budget of the fund if the political subdivision adopts a tax levy that exceeds the estimated maximum levy limits as provided by the department of local

For a fund of a political subdivision subject to levy limits under IC 6-1.1-18.5-3 and for which the political subdivision adopts a tax levy that is not more than the levy limits under IC 6-1.1-18.5-3, the department of local government finance shall review the fund to ensure the adopted budget is fundable based on the unit's adopted tax levy and estimates of available revenues. If the adopted budget is fundable, the department of local government finance shall use the adopted budget as the approved appropriation for the fund for the budget year. As needed, the political subdivision may complete the additional appropriation process through IC 6-1.1-18-5 for these funds during the budget year.

For a fund of the political subdivision subject to levy limits under IC 6-1.1-18.5-3 and for which the political subdivision adopts a tax levy that is not more than the levy limits under IC 6-1.1-18.5-3, if the department of local government finance has determined the adopted budget is not fundable based on the unit's adopted tax levy and estimates of available revenues, the department of local government finance shall calculate and certify the allowable budget that is fundable based on the adopted tax levy and the department's estimates of available revenues.

IC 6-1.1-17-22 Operating balance in debt service fund 
Sec. 22. (a) In determining the amount of the levy for a debt service fund for a budget year, the maximum amount allowed for an operating balance in the debt service fund is the sum of the maximum allowable operating balance for each debt included in the debt service fund. The maximum allowable operating balance for an individual debt shall be calculated as follows: 
(1) 
For debt originally incurred after June 30, 2014, the lesser of: 

(A) 
fifteen percent (15%) of the budget estimate for the debt for the year after the budget year; or 

(B) 
the debt payment to be made in the first six (6) months of the year after the budget year.

the debt payment to be made in the first six (6) months 




of the year after the budget year. If debt is refinanced, the date the refinanced debt was originally incurred, and not the date that the refinancing is closed, is the date to be used for purposes of this subsection. 
(b) For purposes of IC 6-1.1-20.6-9.5, the property taxes allowed for an operating balance in the debt service fund under this section may not be construed as an increase in a political subdivision's property tax levy to make up for a reduction in property tax collections resulting from the application of credits under IC 6-1.1-20.6.
