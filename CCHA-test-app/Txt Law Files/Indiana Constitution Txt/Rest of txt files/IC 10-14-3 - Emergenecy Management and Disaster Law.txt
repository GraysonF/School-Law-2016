Sec. 16. (a) The director of a local organization for emergency management may develop or cause to be developed mutual aid arrangements with other public and private agencies within Indiana for reciprocal emergency management aid and assistance in case of disaster too great to be dealt with unassisted.

(c)
 This subsection applies when the governor finds that two (2) or more adjoining counties would be better served by an interjurisdictional arrangement than by maintaining separate disaster agencies and services. The governor may, with the concurrence of the affected counties, delineate by executive order or regulation an interjurisdictional area adequate to plan for, prevent, or respond to disaster in that area, and direct steps to be taken as necessary, including the creation of an interjurisdictional relationship, a joint emergency operations plan, mutual aid, or an area organization for emergency management planning and services. A finding of the governor under this subsection must be based on one (1) or more factors related to the difficulty of maintaining an efficient and effective disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery system on a unijurisdictional basis, including the following factors: 

(1) 
Small or sparse population. 

(2) 
Limitations on public financial resources severe enough to make maintenance of a separate disaster agency and services unreasonably burdensome. 

(3) 
Unusual vulnerability to disaster as evidenced by a history of disaster, topographical features, drainage characteristics, disaster potential, and presence of disaster prone facilities or operations. 

(4) 
The interrelated character of the counties in a multicounty area. 

(5) 
Other relevant conditions or circumstances. 




(d) If the governor finds that: 
(1) 
a vulnerable area lies partly in Indiana and includes territory in another state or states; and 

(2) 
it would be desirable to establish an interstate relationship, 


mutual aid, or an area organization for disaster; the governor shall take steps to establish an interstate relationship. If action under this subsection is taken with jurisdictions that have enacted the emergency management assistance compact, any resulting agreement or agreements may be considered supplemental agreements under article 7 of the compact. 
(e) If the other jurisdiction or jurisdictions with which the governor proposes to cooperate under subsection (d) have not enacted the emergency management assistance compact, the governor may negotiate special agreements with the jurisdiction or jurisdictions. An agreement, if sufficient authority for making the agreement does not otherwise exist, becomes effective only: 
(1) 
after the agreement's text has been communicated to the general assembly; and 

(2) 
if a house of the general assembly does not disapprove of the agreement by the later of: 

(A) 
the date of adjournment of the next ensuing session that is competent to consider the agreement; or 

(B) 
not more than thirty (30) days after the date of the submission of the agreement.

In conjunction with the agency, an appropriate state agency shall keep land uses and construction of structures and other facilities under continuing study and identify areas that are particularly susceptible to: 

(1) 
severe land shifting; 

(2) 
subsidence;

flood; or 



(4) 
other catastrophic occurrence. The studies under this subsection must concentrate on means of reducing or avoiding the dangers caused by this occurrence or its consequences. 

(c) 
If the agency believes on the basis of the studies or other competent evidence: 

(1) 
that an area is susceptible to a disaster of catastrophic proportions without adequate warning; 

(2) 
that existing building standards and land use controls in that area are inadequate and could add substantially to the magnitude of the disaster; and 

(3) 
that changes in zoning regulations, other land use regulations, or building requirements are essential in order to further the purposes of this section; 




the agency shall specify the essential changes to the governor. The governor shall recommend changes to the agencies or local governments with jurisdiction over the area and subject matter that the governor finds to be essential upon review of the specified changes and a public hearing. If no action or insufficient action under the governor's recommendations is taken within the time specified by the governor, the governor shall inform the general assembly and request legislative action appropriate to mitigate the effect of disaster. 
(d) The governor, at the same time that the governor makes recommendations under subsection (c), may: 
(1) suspend the standard or control that the governor finds to be inadequate to protect the public safety; and 
(2) by rule place a new standard or control in effect. The new standard or control remains in effect until rejected by concurrent resolution of both houses of the general assembly or amended by the governor. When it is in effect, the standard or control contained in the governor's regulation is administered and given full effect by all relevant regulatory agencies of the state and local governments to which it applies. Any action taken by the governor under this section is subject to judicial review, but no court has jurisdiction to stay or restrain that action before a hearing on the merits.

Compensation for services or for the taking or use of property may be made only to the extent:

(b) 
Personal services may not be compensated by the state or any subdivision or agency of the state except under statute, local law, or ordinance.

Sec. 32. (a) The general assembly intends and declares to be the policy of the state that funds to meet disaster emergencies always be available. 
(b) 
The general assembly intends that the first recourse shall be to funds regularly appropriated to state and local agencies. If the governor finds that the demands placed upon these funds in coping with a particular disaster are unreasonably great, the governor may make funds available from money in the budget agency from emergency or contingency appropriations available for emergency expenditures as provided in IC 4-12-1-15. 

(c) 
Within the limits of the funds appropriated under this section, the governor may contribute to a political subdivision not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of emergency management agency personnel and administrative expenses that meet standards
