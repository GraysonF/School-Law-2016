IC 6-1.1-3-23 General assemblyfindings; electionofvaluationmethodforspecial integrated steel mill or oil refinery; petrochemical equipment 
Sec. 23. (a) In enacting this section, the general assembly finds the following: 
(1) 
The economy of northern Indiana has historically been heavily dependent upon: 

(A) 
the domestic steel industry, particularly the integrated steel mill business, which produces steel from basic raw materials through blast furnace and related operations; and 

(B) 
the oil refining and petrochemical industry. 



(2) 
Northern Indiana is the only area of Indiana with integrated steelmaking facilities. 

(3) 
During the last thirty (30) years, the domestic steel industry has experienced significant financial difficulties. More than one-half (1/2) of the integrated steel mills in the United States were shut down or deintegrated, with the remainder requiring significant investment and the addition of new processes to make the facilities economically competitive with newer foreign and domestic steelmaking facilities and processes. 

(4) 
The United States needs to protect the capacity of the oil refining and petrochemical industry. No oil refineries have been built in the United States since 1976. 

(5) 
Given the economic conditions affecting older integrated steelmaking facilities, integrated steel mills claimed abnormal obsolescence in reporting the assessed value of equipment located at the integrated steelmaking facilities that began operations before 1970, thereby reporting the equipment's assessed value at far below thirty percent (30%) of the equipment's total cost (far below the "thirty percent (30%) floor" value generally applicable to equipment exhibiting only 

normal obsolescence under the current department of local government finance rules). 

(6) 
Current law existing before January 1, 2003, obligates the taxpayers making abnormal obsolescence claims to pay personal propertytaxes based only on, and permits communities to determine property tax budgets and rates based only on, the reported personal property assessed values until the personal property appeals are resolved. Consequently, as a result of abnormal obsolescence claims, the property tax base of communities in northern Indiana is severely reduced for an indeterminate period (if not permanently). The prospect of future appeals and their attendant problems on an ongoing basis must be addressed. 

(7) 
A new, optional method for valuing the equipment of integrated steel mills and entities that are at least fifty percent (50%) owned by an affiliate of an integrated steel mill ("related entities") and the oil refining and petrochemical industry in northern Indiana is needed. That optional method: 

(A) 
recognizes the loss of value and difficulty in valuing equipment at integrated steelmaking facilities and facilities of the oil refining and petrochemical industry that commenced operations decades ago and at the facilities of related entities; 

(B) 
recognizes that depreciable personal property used in integrated steelmaking and in oil refinery or petrochemical operations and by related entities is affected by different economic and market forces than depreciable personal property used in other industries and certain other segments of the steel industry and therefore experiences different amounts of obsolescence and depreciation; and 

(C) 
can be used to simply and efficiently arrive at a value commensurate with that property's age, use, obsolescence, and market circumstances instead of the current method and its potentially contentious and lengthy appeals. Such an optional method would benefit the communities where these older facilities are located. 



(8) 
Such an optional method would be to authorize a fifth pool in the depreciation schedule for valuing the equipment of integrated steel mills, related entities, and the oil refining and petrochemical industry that reflects all adjustments to the value of that equipment for depreciation and obsolescence, including abnormal obsolescence, which precludes any taxpayer electing such a method from taking any other obsolescence adjustment for the equipment, and which applies only at the election of the taxpayer. 

(9) 
The purpose for authorizing the Pool 5 method is to provide a more simplified and efficient method for valuing the equipment of integrated steel mills and the oil refining and 

petrochemical industry that recognizes the loss of value and unusual problems associated with the valuation of the equipment or facilities that began operations before 1970 in those industries in northern Indiana, as well as for valuing the equipment of related entities, to stabilize local property tax revenue by eliminating the need for abnormal obsolescence claims, and to encourage those industries to continue to invest in northern Indiana, thereby contributing to the economic life and well-being of communities in northern Indiana, the residents of northern Indiana, and Indiana generally. 

(10) 
The specific circumstances described in this section do not exist throughout the rest of Indiana. 


(b) For purposes of this section: 
(1) 
"adjusted cost" refers to the adjusted cost established in 50 IAC 4.2-4-4 (as in effect on January 1, 2003); 

(2) 
"depreciable personal property" has the meaning set forth in 50 IAC 4.2-4-1 (as in effect on January 1, 2003); 

(3) 
"integrated steel mill" means a person, including a subsidiary of a corporation, that produces steel by processing iron ore and other raw materials in a blast furnace in Indiana; 

(4) 
"oil refinery/petrochemical company" means a person that produces a variety of petroleum products by processing an annual average of at least one hundred thousand (100,000) barrels of crude oil per day; 

(5) 
"permanently retired depreciable personal property" has the meaning set forth in 50 IAC 4.2-4-3 (as in effect on January 1, 2003); 

(6) 
"pool" refers to a pool established in 50 IAC 4.2-4-5(a) (as in effect on January 1, 2003); 

(7) 
"special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment" means depreciable personal property, other than special tools and permanently retired depreciable personal property: 

(A) 
that: 

(i)
 is owned, leased, or used by an integrated steel mill or an entity that is at least fifty percent (50%) owned by an affiliate of an integrated steel mill; and 

(ii) 
falls within Asset Class 33.4 as set forth in IRS Rev. Proc. 87-56, 1987-2, C.B. 647; or 



(B) 
that: 

(i) 
is owned, leased, or used as an integrated part of an oil refinery/petrochemical company or its affiliate; and 

(ii) 
falls within Asset Class 13.3 or 28.0 as set forth in IRS Rev. Proc. 87-56, 1987-2, C.B. 647; 





(8) 
"special tools" has the meaning set forth in 50 IAC 4.2-6-2 (as in effect on January 1, 2003); and 

(9) 
"year of acquisition" refers to the year of acquisition determined under 50 IAC 4.2-4-6 (as in effect on January 1, 


2003). 
(c) 
Notwithstanding 50 IAC 4.2-4-4, 50 IAC 4.2-4-6, and 50 IAC 4.2-4-7, a taxpayer may elect to calculate the true tax value of the taxpayer's special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment by multiplying the adjusted cost of that equipment by the percentage set forth in the following table: 

Year of Acquisition 	Percentage 1 40% 2 56% 3 42% 4 32% 5 24% 6 18% 7 15% 8 and older 10% 

(d) 
The department of local government finance shall designate the table under subsection (c) as "Pool No. 5" on the business personal property tax return. 

(e) 
The percentage factors in the table under subsection (c) automatically reflect all adjustments for depreciation and obsolescence, including abnormal obsolescence, for special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment. The equipment is entitled to all exemptions, credits, and deductions for which it qualifies. 

(f) 
The minimum valuation limitations under 50 IAC 4.2-4-9 do not apply to special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment valued under this section. The value of the equipment is not included in the calculation of that minimum valuation limitation for the taxpayer's other assessable depreciable personal property in the taxing district. 

(g) 
An election to value special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment under this section: 

(1) 
must be made by reporting the equipment under this section on a business personal property tax return; 

(2) 
applies to all of the taxpayer's special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment located in the state (whether owned or leased, or used as an integrated part of the equipment); and 

(3) 
is binding on the taxpayer for the assessment date for which 




the election is made. The department of local government finance shall prescribe the forms to make the election beginning with the March 1, 2003, assessment date. Any special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment acquired by a taxpayer that has made an election under this section is valued under this section. 
(h) If fifty percent (50%) or more of the adjusted cost of a taxpayer's property that would, notwithstanding this section, be reported in a pool other than Pool No. 5 is attributable to special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment, the taxpayer may elect to calculate the true tax value of all of that property as special integrated steel mill or oil refinery/petrochemical equipment. The true tax value of property for which an election is made under this subsection is calculated under subsections (c) through (g).

In making the annual determination of the base rate to satisfy the requirement for an annual adjustment under subsection (c) for the January 1, 2016, assessment date and each assessment date thereafter, the department of local government finance shall determine the base rate using the methodology reflected in Table 2-18 of Book 1, Chapter 2 of the department of local government finance's Real Property Assessment Guidelines (as in effect on January 1, 2005), except that the department shall adjust the methodology as follows: 

(1) 
Use a six (6) year rolling average adjusted under subdivision 

(3) 
instead of a four (4) year rolling average. 

(2) 
Use the data from the six (6) most recent years preceding the year in which the assessment date occurs for which data is available, before one (1) of those six (6) years is eliminated under subdivision (3) when determining the rolling average. 

(3) 
Eliminate in the calculation of the rolling average the year among the six (6) years for which the highest market value in use of agricultural land is determined. 

(4) 
After determining a preliminary base rate that would apply 




for the assessment date without applying the adjustment under this subdivision, the department of local government finance shall adjust the preliminary base rate as follows: 
(A) 
If the preliminary base rate for the assessment date would be at least ten percent (10%) greater than the final base rate determined for the preceding assessment date, a capitalization rate of eight percent (8%) shall be used to determine the final base rate. 

(B) 
If the preliminary base rate for the assessment date would be at least ten percent (10%) less than the final base rate determined for the preceding assessment date, a capitalization rate of six percent (6%) shall be used to determine the final base rate. 

(C) 
If neither clause (A) nor clause (B) applies, a capitalization rate of seven percent (7%) shall be used to determine the final base rate. 

(D) 
In the case of a market value in use for a year that is used in the calculation of the six (6) year rolling average under subdivision (1) for purposes of determining the base rate for the assessment date: 

(i)
 that market value in use shall be recalculated by using the capitalization rate determined under clauses (A) through (C) for the calculation of the base rate for the assessment date; and 

(ii) 
the market value in use recalculated under item (i) shall be used in the calculation of the six (6) year rolling average under subdivision (1). 




(f) For assessment dates after December 31, 2009, an adjustment in the assessed value of real property under this section shall be based on the estimated true tax value of the property on the assessment date that is the basis for taxes payable on that real property.

IC 6-1.1-4-31.5 State conductedassessment or reassessment; notice; state contract with appraising firm; state review of contract; land values; contract payment; severability 
Sec. 31.5. (a) As used in this section, "department" refers to the department of local government finance. 
(b) 
If the department makes a determination and informs local officials under section 31(c) of this chapter, the department may order a state conducted assessment or reassessment in the county subject to the time limitation in that subsection. 

(c) 
If the department orders a state conducted assessment or reassessment in a county, the department shall assume the duties of the county assessor. Notwithstanding sections 15 and 17 of this chapter, a county assessor subject to an order issued under this section may not assess property or have property assessed for the assessment or general reassessment under section 4 of this chapter or under a county's reassessment plan prepared under section 4.2 of this chapter. Until the state conducted assessment or reassessment is completed under this section, the assessment or reassessment duties of the county assessor are limited to providing the department or a contractor of the department the support and information requested by the department or the contractor. 

(d) 
Before assuming the duties of a county assessor, the department shall transmit a copy of the department's order requiring a state conducted assessment or reassessment to the county assessor, the county fiscal body, the county auditor, and the county treasurer. Notice of the department's actions must be published one (1) time in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county. The department is not required to conduct a public hearing before taking action under this section. 

(e) 
A county assessor subject to an order issued under this section shall, at the request of the department or the department's contractor, make available and provide access to all:

data; 

(2) 
records; 

(3) 
maps; 

(4) 
parcel record cards; 

(5)

(6) 
computer software systems; 

(7) 
computer hardware systems; and 



(8) 
other information; related to the assessment or reassessment of real property in the county. The information described in this subsection must be provided at no cost to the department or the contractor of the department. A failure to provide information requested under this subsection constitutes a failure to perform a duty related to an assessment or a general reassessment under section 4 of this chapter or under a county's reassessment plan prepared under section 4.2 of this chapter and is subject to IC 6-1.1-37-2. 

(f)
 The department may enter into a contract with a professional appraising firm to conduct an assessment or reassessment under this section. If a county entered into a contract with a professional appraising firm to conduct the county's assessment or reassessment before the department orders a state conducted assessment or reassessment in the county under this section, the contract: 

(1) 
is as valid as if it had been entered into by the department; and 

(2) 
shall be treated as the contract of the department. 



(g) 
After receiving the report of assessed values from the appraisal firm acting under a contract described in subsection (f), the department shall give notice to the taxpayer and the county assessor, by mail, of the amount of the assessment or reassessment. The notice of assessment or reassessment: 

(1) 
is subject to appeal by the taxpayer under section 31.7 of this chapter; and 

(2) 
must include a statement of the taxpayer's rights under section 31.7 of this chapter. 



(h) 
The department shall forward a bill for services provided under a contract described in subsection (f) to the auditor of the county in which the state conducted reassessment occurs. The county 

shall pay the bill under the procedures prescribed by subsection (i). 

(i) 
A county subject to an order issued under this section shall pay the cost of a contract described in subsection (f), without appropriation, from the county property reassessment fund. A contractor may periodically submit bills for partial payment of work performed under the contract. Notwithstanding any other law, a contractor is entitled to payment under this subsection for work performed under a contract if the contractor: 

(1) 
submits to the department a fully itemized, certified bill in the form required by IC 5-11-10-1 for the costs of the work performed under the contract; 

(2) 
obtains from the department: 

(A) 
approval of the form and amount of the bill; and 

(B) 
a certification that the billed goods and services have been received and comply with the contract; and 



(3) 
files with the county auditor: 

(A) 
a duplicate copy of the bill submitted to the department; 

(B) 
proof of the department's approval of the form and amount of the bill; and 

(C) 
the department's certification that the billed goods and 






services have been received and comply with the contract. The department's approval and certification of a bill under subdivision (2) shall be treated as conclusively resolving the merits of a contractor's claim. Upon receipt of the documentation described in subdivision (3), the county auditor shall immediately certify that the bill is true and correct without further audit and submit the claim to the county executive. The county executive shall allow the claim, in full, as approved by the department, without further examination of the merits of the claim in a regular or special session that is held not less than three (3) days and not more than seven (7) days after the date the claim is certified by the county fiscal officer if the procedures in IC 5-11-10-2 are used to approve the claim or the date the claim is placed on the claim docket under IC 36-2-6-4 if the procedures in IC 36-2-6-4 are used to approve the claim. Upon allowance of the claim by the county executive, the county auditor shall immediately issue a warrant or check for the full amount of the claim approved by the department. Compliance with this subsection constitutes compliance with IC 5-11-6-1, IC 5-11-10, and IC 36-2-6. The determination and payment of a claim in compliance with this subsection is not subject to remonstrance and appeal. IC 36-2-6-4(f) and IC 36-2-6-9 do not apply to a claim submitted under this subsection. IC 5-11-10-1.6(d) applies to a fiscal officer who pays a claim in compliance with this subsection. 
(j) 
Notwithstanding IC 4-13-2, a period of seven (7) days is permitted for each of the following to review and act under IC 4-13-2 on a contract of the department entered into under this section: 

(1) 
The commissioner of the Indiana department of administration. 

(2) 
The director of the budget agency. 

(3) 
The attorney general. 



(k) 
If money in the county's property reassessment fund is insufficient to pay for an assessment or reassessment conducted under this section, the department may increase the tax rate and tax levy of the county's property reassessment fund to pay the cost and expenses related to the assessment or reassessment. 

(l) 
The department or the contractor of the department shall use the land values determined under section 13.6 of this chapter for a county subject to an order issued under this section to the extent that the department or the contractor finds that the land values reflect the true tax value of land, as determined under this article and the rules of the department. If the department or the contractor finds that the land values determined for the county under section 13.6 of this chapter do not reflect the true tax value of land, the department or the contractor shall determine land values for the county that reflect the true tax value of land, as determined under this article and the rules of the department. Land values determined under this subsection shall be used to the same extent as if the land values had been determined under section 13.6 of this chapter. The department or the contractor of the department shall notify the county's assessing officials of the land values determined under this subsection. 


(m) A contractor of the department may notify the department if: 
(1) a county auditor fails to: 
(A) 
certify the contractor's bill; 

(B) 
publish the contractor's claim; 

(C) 
submit the contractor's claim to the county executive; or 

(D) 
issue a warrant or check for payment of the contractor's 


bill; as required by subsection (i) at the county auditor's first legal opportunity to do so; 
(2) 
a county executive fails to allow the contractor's claim as legally required by subsection (i) at the county executive's first legal opportunity to do so; or 

(3) 
a person or an entity authorized to act on behalf of the county takes or fails to take an action, including failure to request an appropriation, and that action or failure to act delays or halts progress under this section for payment of the contractor's bill. 


(n) The department, upon receiving notice under subsection (m) from a contractor of the department, shall: 
(1) 
verify the accuracy of the contractor's assertion in the notice that: 

(A) 
a failure occurred as described in subsection (m)(1) or (m)(2); or 

(B) 
a person or an entity acted or failed to act as described in subsection (m)(3); and 



(2) 
provide to the treasurer of state the department's approval 


under subsection (i)(2)(A) of the contractor's bill with respect to which the contractor gave notice under subsection (m). 
(o) 
Upon receipt of the department's approval of a contractor's bill under subsection (n), the treasurer of state shall pay the contractor the amount of the bill approved by the department from money in the possession of the state that would otherwise be available for distribution to the county, including distributions of admissions taxes or wagering taxes. 

(p) 
The treasurer of state shall withhold from the money that would be distributed under IC 4-33-12-6, IC 4-33-13-5, or any other law to a county described in a notice provided under subsection (m) the amount of a payment made by the treasurer of state to the contractor of the department under subsection (o). Money shall be withheld from any source payable to the county. 

(q) 
Compliance with subsections (m) through (p) constitutes compliance with IC 5-11-10. 

(r) 
IC 5-11-10-1.6(d) applies to the treasurer of state with respect to the payment made in compliance with subsections (m) through (p). This subsection and subsections (m) through (p) must be interpreted liberally so that the state shall, to the extent legally valid, ensure that the contractual obligations of a county subject to this section are paid. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create a debt of the state. 

(s) 
The provisions of this section are severable as provided in IC 1-1-1-8(b).

(1) 
Cost approach that includes an estimated reproduction or replacement cost of buildings and land improvements as of the date of valuation together with estimates of the losses in value that have taken place due to wear and tear, design and plan, or neighborhood influences. 

(2) 
Sales comparison approach, using data for generally comparable property. 

(3) 
Income capitalization approach, using an applicable capitalization method and appropriate capitalization rates that are developed and used in computations that lead to an indication of value commensurate with the risks for the subject property use. 


(b) 
The gross rent multiplier method is the preferred method of valuing: 

(1) 
real property that has at least one (1) and not more than four 

(4) 
rental units; and

(c) 
A township assessor (if any) or the county assessor is not required to appraise real property referred to in subsection (a) using the three (3) appraisal approaches listed in subsection (a) if the assessor and the taxpayer agree before notice of the assessment is 

given to the taxpayer under section 22 of this chapter to the determination of the true tax value of the property by the assessor using one (1) of those appraisal approaches. 

(d) 
To carry out this section, the department of local government finance may adopt rules for assessors to use in gathering and processing information for the application of the income capitalization method and the gross rent multiplier method. If a taxpayer wishes to have the income capitalization method or the gross rent multiplier method used in the initial formulation of the assessment of the taxpayer's property, the taxpayer must submit the necessary information to the assessor not later than the assessment date. However, the taxpayer is not prejudiced in any way and is not restricted in pursuing an appeal, if the data is not submitted by the assessment date. A taxpayer must verify under penalties for perjury any information provided to the township or county assessor for use in the application of either method. All information related to earnings, income, profits, losses, or expenditures that is provided to the assessor under this section is confidential under IC 6-1.1-35-9 to the same extent as information related to earnings, income, profits, losses, or expenditures of personal property is confidential under IC 6-1.1-35-9.

Sec. 37. (a) If: 
(1) 
the department of local government finance's reassessment of distributable property is less than the department's original assessment; or 

(2) 
the Indiana board's reassessment of distributable property is 


less than the department's original assessment; the auditor of each affected county shall compute the tax refund, if any, which is due the public utility company. The county auditor shall then issue a warrant to the company for the amount of the refund due, and the county treasurer shall pay the warrant, without an appropriation for the disbursement. 
(b) If: 
(1) 
the department of local government finance's reassessment of distributable property is greater than the department's original assessment; or 

(2)

(c) The accounts of the various taxing units shall be credited or charged with each unit's proportionate share of additional taxes collected and refunds made under this section. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) As amended by P.L.90-2002, SEC.83.

In addition, the taxes are a personal debt of the public utility company in whose name the property is assessed. 
(b) If a public utility company does not pay the taxes when they are due, the county treasurer shall notify the prosecuting attorney of that fact. The prosecuting attorney shall then bring an action against the company to recover the delinquent taxes or to enforce the lien upon the property, or both. In such an action, the judgment shall include a penalty equal to fifty percent (50%) of the delinquent taxes. This subsection does not apply to taxes on a railroad car company's indefinite-situs distributable property. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) 
IC 6-1.1-8-39 Omitted property; assessment 
Sec. 39. The annual assessments of a public utility company's property are presumed to include all the company's property which is subject to taxation under this chapter. However, this presumption does not preclude the subsequent assessment of a specific item of tangible property which is clearly shown to have been omitted from the assessments for that year. The appropriate township assessor, or the county assessor if there is no township assessor for the township, shall make assessments of omitted fixed property. The department of local government finance shall make assessments of omitted distributable property. However, the department of local government finance may not assess omitted distributable property after the expiration of ten (10) years from the last day of the year in which the assessment should have been made.

IC 6-1.1-8-40 Omitted property; rate of assessment; interest 
Sec. 40. When the department of local government finance assesses distributable property which was omitted from the assessment for a particular year, the department shall, as nearly as possible, assess the omitted distributable property in the same manner that the department assesses otherdistributable property. The taxes due on the omitted distributable property shall be calculated by using the same tax rates which were applicable for the tax year that the distributable property was omitted from the assessment. The public utility company shall pay interest on the taxes due on the omitted distributable property at the rate of two percent (2%) per month, or fraction of a month. The interest due shall be calculated on the period of time beginning with January 1 of the year following the year in which the property was omitted from the assessment and ending with the day the taxes are paid. However, the department of local government finance may waive any portion of the interest due under this section at the time the department makes its final assessment of the omitted distributable property.

(b) The department of local government finance may adopt rules and regulations to carry out the intent and provisions of this chapter. The rules and regulations must be consistent with this chapter. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) As amended by P.L.90-2002, SEC.87.

IC 6-1.1-10-46 Property tax exemption; for profit early childhood education provider 
Sec. 46. (a) Tangible property owned, occupied, or used by a for-profit provider of early childhood education services to children who are at least four (4) but less than six (6) years of age is exempt from property taxation under section 16 of this chapter only if all the following requirements are satisfied: 
(1) 
The primary purpose of the provider is educational. 

(2) 
The provider is the property owner and the provider also predominantly occupies and uses the tangible property for providing early childhood education services to children who are at least four (4) but less than six (6) years of age. 

(3) 
The provider participates in the early education evaluation program established under IC 12-17.2-3.8 and meets the standards of quality recognized by a Level 3 or Level 4 Paths to QUALITY program rating or has a comparable rating from a nationally recognized accrediting body. 


If the property owner provides early childhood education services to children who are at least four (4) but less than six (6) years of age and to children younger than four (4) years of age, the amount of the exemption must be on that part of the assessment of the property that bears the same proportion to the total assessment of the property as the percentage of the property owner's enrollment count of children who are at least four (4) but less than six (6) years of age compared to the property owner's total enrollment count of children of all ages. 
(b) For purposes of this section, the annual assessment date or, if the annual assessment date is not a business day for the property owner, the business day closest to the annual assessment date, must be used for the enrollment count under this section. However, a property owner that believes that the enrollment count on this date for a particular year does not accurately represent the property owner's normal enrollment count for that year may appeal to the county assessor for a change in the date to be used under this section for that year. The appeal must be filed on or before the deadline for filing an exemption under section 16 of this chapter. If the county assessor finds that the property owner's appeal substantiates that the property owner's normal enrollment count is not accurately represented by using the required date, the assessor shall establish an alternate date to be used for that year that represents the property owner's normal enrollment count for that year.

Upon receipt of the exemption application, the county assessor shall examine that record and determine if the real property for which the exemption is claimed is properly assessed. If the county assessor determines that the real property is not properly assessed, the county assessor shall: 

(1) 
properly assess the real property or direct the township assessor to properly assess the real property; and

However, if the property remains eligible for an exemption under IC 6-1.1-10 following the transfer or change in use, the exemption shall be left in place for that assessment date. For the following assessment date, the person that obtained the exemption or the current owner of the property, as applicable, shall, under section 3 of this chapter and except as provided in this section, file a certified application in duplicate with the county assessor of the county in which the property that is the subject of the exemption is located.

With respect to real property, the statement must be completed and dated in the calendar year for which the person desires to obtain the deduction and filed with the county auditor on or before January 5 of the immediately succeeding calendar year. With respect to a mobile home that is not assessed as real property, the person must file the statement during the twelve (12) months before March 31 of the year for which the person desires to obtain the deduction. 
(f) If an individual who is receiving the deduction provided by this section or who otherwise qualifies property for a deduction under this section: 
(1) 
changes the use of the individual's property so that part or all of the property no longer qualifies for the deduction under this section; or 

(2) 
is no longer eligible for a deduction under this section on another parcel of property because:

An individual who fails to file the statement required by this subsection is liable for any additional taxes that would have been due on the property if the individual had filed the statement as required by this subsection plus a civil penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the additional taxes due. The civil penalty imposed under this subsection is in addition to any interest and penalties for a delinquent payment that might otherwise be due. One percent (1%) of the total civil penalty collected under this subsection shall be transferred by the county to the department of local government finance for use by the department in establishing and maintaining the homestead property data base under subsection

and, to the extent there is money remaining, for any other purposes of the department. This amount becomes part of the property tax liability for purposes of this article. 

(g) 
The department of local government finance may adopt rules or guidelines concerning the application for a deduction under this section. 

(h) 
This subsection does not apply to property in the first year for which a deduction is claimed under this section if the sole reason that a deduction is claimed on other property is that the individual or married couple maintained a principal residence at the other property on March 1 in the same year in which an application for a deduction is filed under this section or, if the application is for a homestead that is assessed as personal property, on March 1 in the immediately preceding year and the individual or married couple is moving the individual's or married couple's principal residence to the property that is the subject of the application. Except as provided in subsection (n), the county auditor may not grant an individual or a married couple a deduction under this section if: 

(1) 
the individual or married couple, for the same year, claims the deduction on two (2) or more different applications for the deduction; and 

(2) 
the applications claim the deduction for different property. 



(i) 
The department of local government finance shall provide secure access to county auditors to a homestead property data base that includes access to the homestead owner's name and the numbers required from the homestead owner under subsection (e)(4) for the sole purpose of verifying whether an owner is wrongly claiming a deduction under this chapter or a credit under IC 6-1.1-20.4, IC 6-1.1-20.6, or IC 6-3.5. 

(j) 
A county auditor may require an individual to provide evidence proving that the individual's residence is the individual's principal place of residence as claimed in the certified statement filed under subsection (e). The county auditor may limit the evidence that an individual is required to submit to a state income tax return, a valid driver's license, or a valid voter registration card showing that the residence for which the deduction is claimed is the individual's 

principal place of residence. The department of local government finance shall work with county auditors to develop procedures to determine whether a property owner that is claiming a standard deduction or homestead credit is not eligible for the standard deduction or homestead credit because the property owner's principal place of residence is outside Indiana. 

(k) 
As used in this section, "homestead" includes property that satisfies each of the following requirements: 

(1) 
The property is located in Indiana and consists of a dwelling and the real estate, not exceeding one (1) acre, that immediately surrounds that dwelling. 

(2) 
The property is the principal place of residence of an individual. 

(3) 
The property is owned by an entity that is not described in subsection (a)(2)(B). 

(4) 
The individual residing on the property is a shareholder, partner, or member of the entity that owns the property. 

(5) 
The property was eligible for the standard deduction under this section on March 1, 2009. 



(l) 
If a county auditor terminates a deduction for property described in subsection (k) with respect to property taxes that are: 

(1) imposed for an assessment date in 2009; and 

(2) 
first due and payable in 2010; on the grounds that the property is not owned by an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B), the county auditor shall reinstate the deduction if the taxpayer provides proof that the property is eligible for the deduction in accordance with subsection (k) and that the individual residing on the property is not claiming the deduction for any other property. 

(m) 
For assessment dates after 2009, the term "homestead" includes: 

(1) 
a deck or patio; 

(2) 
a gazebo; or 

(3) 
another residential yard structure, as defined in rules that may be adopted by the department of local government finance (other than a swimming pool); 




that is assessed as real property and attached to the dwelling. 
(n) A county auditor shall grant an individual a deduction under this section regardless of whether the individual and the individual's spouse claim a deduction on two (2) different applications and each application claims a deduction for different property if the property owned by the individual's spouse is located outside Indiana and the individual files an affidavit with the county auditor containing the following information: 
(1) 
The names of the county and state in which the individual's spouse claims a deduction substantially similar to the deduction allowed by this section. 

(2) 
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the 


following are true: 
(A) 
That the individual and the individual's spouse maintain separate principal places of residence. 

(B) 
That neither the individual nor the individual's spouse has an ownership interest in the other's principal place of residence. 

(C) 
That neither the individual nor the individual's spouse has, for that same year, claimed a standard or substantially similar deduction for any property other than the property maintained as a principal place of residence by the respective individuals. 


A county auditor may require an individual or an individual's spouse to provide evidence of the accuracy of the information contained in an affidavit submitted under this subsection. The evidence required of the individual or the individual's spouse may include state income tax returns, excise tax payment information, property tax payment information, driver license information, and voter registration information. 
(o) If: 
(1) 
a property owner files a statement under subsection (e) to claim the deduction provided by this section for a particular property; and 

(2) 
the county auditor receiving the filed statement determines that the property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction; 


the county auditor shall inform the property owner of the county auditor's determination in writing. If a property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction because the county auditor has determined that the property is not the property owner's principal place of residence, the property owner may appeal the county auditor's determination to the county property tax assessment board of appeals as provided in IC 6-1.1-15. The county auditor shall inform the property owner of the owner's right to appeal to the county property tax assessment board of appeals when the county auditor informs the property owner of the county auditor's determination under this subsection. 
(p) An individual is entitled to the deduction under this section for a homestead for a particular assessment date if: 
(1) 
either: 

(A) 
the individual's interest in the homestead as described in subsection (a)(2)(B) is conveyed to the individual after the assessment date, but within the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs; or 

(B) 
the individual contracts to purchase the homestead after the assessment date, but within the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs; 



(2) 
on the assessment date: 

(A) 
the property on which the homestead is currently located 

was vacant land; or 

(B) 
the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed; 



(3) 
either: 

(A) 
the individual files the certified statement required by subsection (e) on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs to claim the deduction under this section; or 

(B) 
a sales disclosure form that meets the requirements of section 44 of this chapter is submitted to the county assessor on or before December 31 of the calendar year for the individual's purchase of the homestead; and 



(4) 
the individual files with the county auditor on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs a statement that lists any other property for which the individual would otherwise receive a deduction under this section for the assessment date. 


An individual who satisfies the requirements of subdivisions (1) through (4) is entitled to the deduction under this section for the homestead for the assessment date, even if on the assessment date the property on which the homestead is currently located was vacant land or the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed. The county auditor shall apply the deduction for the assessment date and for the assessment date in any later year in which the homestead remains eligible for the deduction. A homestead that qualifies for the deduction under this section as provided in this subsection is considered a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter and IC 6-1.1-20.6. 
(q) 
This subsection applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an individual buying a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property under a contract providing that the individual is to pay the property taxes on the mobile home or manufactured home is not entitled to the deduction provided by this section unless the parties to the contract comply with IC 9-17-6-17. 

(r) This subsection: 
(1) applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013; and 

(2) 
does not apply to an individual described in subsection (q). The owner of a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property must attach a copy of the owner's title to the mobile home or manufactured home to the application for the deduction provided by this section. 

(s) 
For assessment dates after 2013, the term "homestead" includes property that is owned by an individual who: 


(1) 
is serving on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States; 

(2) 
was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana; and 

(3) 
was otherwise eligible, without regard to this subsection, for the deduction under this section for the property for the assessment date immediately preceding the transfer date specified in the order described in subdivision (2). 


For property to qualify under this subsection for the deduction provided by this section, the individual described in subdivisions (1) through (3) must submit to the county auditor a copy of the individual's transfer orders or other information sufficient to show that the individual was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana. The property continues to qualify for the deduction provided by this section until the individual ceases to be on active duty, the property is sold, or the individual's ownership interest is otherwise terminated, whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), the property remains a homestead regardless of whether the property continues to be the individual's principal place of residence after the individual transfers to a location outside Indiana. However, the property ceases to qualify as a homestead under this subsection if the property is leased while the individual is away from Indiana.

Except as provided in subsection (k), the term does not include property owned by a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other entity not described in this subdivision. 
(b) Each year a homestead is eligible for a standard deduction from the assessed value of the homestead for an assessment date. Except as provided in subsection (p), the deduction provided by this section applies to property taxes first due and payable for an assessment date only if an individual has an interest in the homestead described in subsection (a)(2)(B) on: 
(1) 
the assessment date; or 

(2) 
any date in the same year after an assessment date that a statement is filed under subsection (e) or section 44 of this chapter, if the property consists of real property. 


If more than one (1) individual or entity qualifies property as a homestead under subsection (a)(2)(B) for an assessment date, only one (1) standard deduction from the assessed value of the homestead may be applied for the assessment date. Subject to subsection (c), the auditor of the county shall record and make the deduction for the individual or entity qualifying for the deduction.

(A) the applicant and the applicant's spouse (if any): 
(i) 
as the names appear in the records of the United States Social Security Administration for the purposes of the issuance of a Social Security card and Social Security number; or 

(ii) 
that they use as their legal names when they sign their 


names on legal documents; 
if the applicant is an individual; or 

(B) each individual who qualifies property as a homestead under subsection (a)(2)(B) and the individual's spouse (if any): 
(i) 
as the names appear in the records of the United States Social Security Administration for the purposes of the issuance of a Social Security card and Social Security number; or 

(ii) 
that they use as their legal names when they sign their 


names on legal documents; 
if the applicant is not an individual; and 

(4) either: 
(A) 
the last five (5) digits of the applicant's Social Security number and the last five (5) digits of the Social Security number of the applicant's spouse (if any); or 

(B) 
if the applicant or the applicant's spouse (if any) does not have a Social Security number, any of the following for that individual: 

(i) 
The last five (5) digits of the individual's driver's 

license number. 

(ii) 
The last five (5) digits of the individual's state identification card number. 




(iii) If the individual does not have a driver's license or a state identification card, the last five (5) digits of a control number that is on a document issued to the individual by the federal government and determined by the department of local government finance to be acceptable. 
If a form or statement provided to the county auditor under this section, IC 6-1.1-22-8.1, or IC 6-1.1-22.5-12 includes the telephone number or part or all of the Social Security number of a party or other number described in subdivision (4)(B) of a party, the telephone number and the Social Security number or other number described in subdivision (4)(B) included are confidential. The statement may be filed in person or by mail. If the statement is mailed, the mailing must be postmarked on or before the last day for filing. The statement applies for that first year and any succeeding year for which the deduction is allowed. With respect to real property, the statement must be completed and dated in the calendar year for which the person desires to obtain the deduction and filed with the county auditor on or before January 5 of the immediately succeeding calendar year. With respect to a mobile home that is not assessed as real property, the person must file the statement during the twelve (12) months before March 31 of the year for which the person desires to obtain the deduction. 
(f) If an individual who is receiving the deduction provided by this section or who otherwise qualifies property for a deduction under this section: 
(1) 
changes the use of the individual's property so that part or all of the property no longer qualifies for the deduction under this section; or 

(2) 
is no longer eligible for a deduction under this section on another parcel of property because: 

(A) 
the individual would otherwise receive the benefit of more than one (1) deduction under this chapter; or 

(B) 
the individual maintains the individual's principal place of residence with another individual who receives a deduction under this section; 




the individual must file a certified statement with the auditor of the county, notifying the auditor of the change of use, not more than sixty (60) days after the date of that change. An individual who fails to file the statement required by this subsection is liable for any additional taxes that would have been due on the property if the individual had filed the statement as required by this subsection plus a civil penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the additional taxes due. The civil penalty imposed under this subsection is in addition to any interest and penalties for a delinquent payment that might otherwise be due. One percent (1%) of the total civil penalty collected under this subsection shall be transferred by the county to the department of local government finance for use by the department in establishing and maintaining the homestead property data base under subsection 
(i) 
and, to the extent there is money remaining, for any other purposes of the department. This amount becomes part of the property tax liability for purposes of this article. 

(g) 
The department of local government finance shall adopt rules or guidelines concerning the application for a deduction under this section. 

(h) 
This subsection does not apply to property in the first year for which a deduction is claimed under this section if the sole reason that a deduction is claimed on other property is that the individual or married couple maintained a principal residence at the other property on March 1 in the same year in which an application for a deduction is filed under this section or, if the application is for a homestead that is assessed as personal property, on March 1 in the immediately preceding year and the individual or married couple is moving the individual's or married couple's principal residence to the property that is the subject of the application. Except as provided in subsection (n), the county auditor may not grant an individual or a married couple a deduction under this section if: 

(1) 
the individual or married couple, for the same year, claims the deduction on two (2) or more different applications for the deduction; and 

(2) 
the applications claim the deduction for different property. 



(i) 
The department of local government finance shall provide secure access to county auditors to a homestead property data base that includes access to the homestead owner's name and the numbers required from the homestead owner under subsection (e)(4) for the sole purpose of verifying whether an owner is wrongly claiming a deduction under this chapter or a credit under IC 6-1.1-20.4, IC 6-1.1-20.6, or IC 6-3.5. 

(j) 
A county auditor may require an individual to provide evidence proving that the individual's residence is the individual's principal place of residence as claimed in the certified statement filed under subsection (e). The county auditor may limit the evidence that an individual is required to submit to a state income tax return, a valid driver's license, or a valid voter registration card showing that the residence for which the deduction is claimed is the individual's principal place of residence. The department of local government finance shall work with county auditors to develop procedures to determine whether a property owner that is claiming a standard deduction or homestead credit is not eligible for the standard deduction or homestead credit because the propertyowner's principal place of residence is outside Indiana. 

(k) 
As used in this section, "homestead" includes property that satisfies each of the following requirements: 

(1) 
The property is located in Indiana and consists of a dwelling 

and the real estate, not exceeding one (1) acre, that immediately surrounds that dwelling. 

(2) 
The property is the principal place of residence of an individual. 

(3) 
The property is owned by an entity that is not described in subsection (a)(2)(B). 

(4) 
The individual residing on the property is a shareholder, partner, or member of the entity that owns the property. 

(5) 
The property was eligible for the standard deduction under this section on March 1, 2009. 



(l) 
If a county auditor terminates a deduction for property described in subsection (k) with respect to property taxes that are: 

(1) imposed for an assessment date in 2009; and 

(2) 
first due and payable in 2010; on the grounds that the property is not owned by an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B), the county auditor shall reinstate the deduction if the taxpayer provides proof that the property is eligible for the deduction in accordance with subsection (k) and that the individual residing on the property is not claiming the deduction for any other property. 

(m) 
For assessment dates after 2009, the term "homestead" includes: 

(1) 
a deck or patio; 

(2) 
a gazebo; or 

(3) 
another residential yard structure, as defined in rules adopted by the department of local government finance (other than a swimming pool); 




that is assessed as real property and attached to the dwelling. 
(n) A county auditor shall grant an individual a deduction under this section regardless of whether the individual and the individual's spouse claim a deduction on two (2) different applications and each application claims a deduction for different property if the property owned by the individual's spouse is located outside Indiana and the individual files an affidavit with the county auditor containing the following information: 
(1) 
The names of the county and state in which the individual's spouse claims a deduction substantially similar to the deduction allowed by this section. 

(2) 
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the following are true: 

(A) 
That the individual and the individual's spouse maintain separate principal places of residence. 

(B) 
That neither the individual nor the individual's spouse has an ownership interest in the other's principal place of residence. 

(C) 
That neither the individual nor the individual's spouse has, for that same year, claimed a standard or substantially similar deduction for any property other than the property 




maintained as a principal place of residence by the 
respective individuals. A county auditor may require an individual or an individual's spouse to provide evidence of the accuracy of the information contained in an affidavit submitted under this subsection. The evidence required of the individual or the individual's spouse may include state income tax returns, excise tax payment information, property tax payment information, driver license information, and voter registration information. 
(o) If: 
(1) 
a property owner files a statement under subsection (e) to claim the deduction provided by this section for a particular property; and 

(2) 
the county auditor receiving the filed statement determines that the property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction; 


the county auditor shall inform the property owner of the county auditor's determination in writing. If a property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction because the county auditor has determined that the property is not the property owner's principal place of residence, the property owner may appeal the county auditor's determination to the county property tax assessment board of appeals as provided in IC 6-1.1-15. The county auditor shall inform the property owner of the owner's right to appeal to the county property tax assessment board of appeals when the county auditor informs the property owner of the county auditor's determination under this subsection. 
(p) An individual is entitled to the deduction under this section for a homestead for a particular assessment date if: 
(1) 
either: 

(A) 
the individual's interest in the homestead as described in subsection (a)(2)(B) is conveyed to the individual after the assessment date, but within the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs; or 

(B) 
the individual contracts to purchase the homestead after the assessment date, but within the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs; 



(2) 
on the assessment date: 

(A) 
the property on which the homestead is currently located was vacant land; or 

(B) 
the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed; 



(3) 
either: 

(A) 
the individual files the certified statement required by subsection (e) on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs to claim the deduction under this section; or 

(B) 
a sales disclosure form that meets the requirements of 




section 44 of this chapter is submitted to the county assessor on or before December 31 of the calendar year for the individual's purchase of the homestead; and 
(4) the individual files with the county auditor on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs a statement that: 
(A) 
lists any other property for which the individual would otherwise receive a deduction under this section for the assessment date; and 

(B) 
cancels the deduction described in clause (A) for that 


property. An individual who satisfies the requirements of subdivisions (1) through (4) is entitled to the deduction under this section for the homestead for the assessment date, even if on the assessment date the property on which the homestead is currently located was vacant land or the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed. The county auditor shall apply the deduction for the assessment date and for the assessment date in any later year in which the homestead remains eligible for the deduction. A homestead that qualifies for the deduction under this section as provided in this subsection is considered a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter and IC 6-1.1-20.6. The county auditor shall cancel the deduction under this section for any property that is located in the county and is listed on the statement filed by the individual under subdivision (4). If the property listed on the statement filed under subdivision (4) is located in another county, the county auditor who receives the statement shall forward the statement to the county auditor of that other county, and the county auditor of that other county shall cancel the deduction under this section for that property. 
(q) 
This subsection applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an individual buying a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property under a contract providing that the individual is to pay the property taxes on the mobile home or manufactured home is not entitled to the deduction provided by this section unless the parties to the contract comply with IC 9-17-6-17. 

(r) This subsection: 
(1) applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013; and 

(2) 
does not apply to an individual described in subsection (q). The owner of a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property must attach a copy of the owner's title to the mobile home or manufactured home to the application for the deduction provided by this section. 

(s) 
For assessment dates after 2013, the term "homestead" includes property that is owned by an individual who: 

(1) 
is serving on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States; 

(2) 
was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana; and 

(3) 
was otherwise eligible, without regard to this subsection, for the deduction under this section for the property for the assessment date immediately preceding the transfer date specified in the order described in subdivision (2). 




For property to qualify under this subsection for the deduction provided by this section, the individual described in subdivisions (1) through (3) must submit to the county auditor a copy of the individual's transfer orders or other information sufficient to show that the individual was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana. The property continues to qualify for the deduction provided by this section until the individual ceases to be on active duty, the property is sold, or the individual's ownership interest is otherwise terminated, whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), the property remains a homestead regardless of whether the property continues to be the individual's principal place of residence after the individual transfers to a location outside Indiana. However, the property ceases to qualify as a homestead under this subsection if the property is leased while the individual is away from Indiana. Property that qualifies as a homestead under this subsection shall also be construed as a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter.

One percent (1%) of the total civil penalty collected under this subsection shall be transferred by the county to the department of local government finance for use by the department in establishing and maintaining the homestead property data base under subsection 
(i) 
and, to the extent there is money remaining, for any other purposes of the department. This amount becomes part of the property tax liability for purposes of this article. 

(g) 
The department of local government finance shall adopt rules or guidelines concerning the application for a deduction under this section. 

(h) 
This subsection does not apply to property in the first year for which a deduction is claimed under this section if the sole reason that a deduction is claimed on other property is that the individual or married couple maintained a principal residence at the other property on the assessment date in the same year in which an application for a deduction is filed under this section or, if the application is for a homestead that is assessed as personal property, on the assessment date in the immediately preceding year and the individual or married couple is moving the individual's or married couple's principal residence to the property that is the subject of the application. Except as provided in subsection (n), the county auditor may not grant an individual or a married couple a deduction under this section if: 

(1) 
the individual or married couple, for the same year, claims the deduction on two (2) or more different applications for the deduction; and 

(2) 
the applications claim the deduction for different property. 



(i) 
The department of local government finance shall provide secure access to county auditors to a homestead property data base that includes access to the homestead owner's name and the numbers required from the homestead owner under subsection (e)(4) for the sole purpose of verifying whether an owner is wrongly claiming a deduction under this chapter or a credit under IC 6-1.1-20.4, IC 6-1.1-20.6, or IC 6-3.5. 

(j) 
A county auditor may require an individual to provide evidence proving that the individual's residence is the individual's principal place of residence as claimed in the certified statement filed under subsection (e). The county auditor may limit the evidence that an individual is required to submit to a state income tax return, a valid driver's license, or a valid voter registration card showing that the residence for which the deduction is claimed is the individual's principal place of residence. The department of local government finance shall work with county auditors to develop procedures to determine whether a property owner that is claiming a standard deduction or homestead credit is not eligible for the standard deduction orhomestead credit because the property owner's principal place of residence is outside Indiana. 

(k) 
As used in this section, "homestead" includes property that satisfies each of the following requirements: 

(1) 
The property is located in Indiana and consists of a dwelling and the real estate, not exceeding one (1) acre, that immediately 

surrounds that dwelling. 

(2) 
The property is the principal place of residence of an individual. 

(3) 
The property is owned by an entity that is not described in subsection (a)(2)(B). 

(4) 
The individual residing on the property is a shareholder, partner, or member of the entity that owns the property. 

(5) 
The property was eligible for the standard deduction under this section on March 1, 2009. 



(l) 
If a county auditor terminates a deduction for property described in subsection (k) with respect to property taxes that are: 

(1) imposed for an assessment date in 2009; and 

(2) 
first due and payable in 2010; on the grounds that the property is not owned by an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B), the county auditor shall reinstate the deduction if the taxpayer provides proof that the property is eligible for the deduction in accordance with subsection (k) and that the individual residing on the property is not claiming the deduction for any other property. 

(m) 
For assessment dates after 2009, the term "homestead" includes: 

(1) 
a deck or patio; 

(2) 
a gazebo; or 

(3) 
another residential yard structure, as defined in rules adopted by the department of local government finance (other than a swimming pool); 




that is assessed as real property and attached to the dwelling. 
(n) A county auditor shall grant an individual a deduction under this section regardless of whether the individual and the individual's spouse claim a deduction on two (2) different applications and each application claims a deduction for different property if the property owned by the individual's spouse is located outside Indiana and the individual files an affidavit with the county auditor containing the following information: 
(1) 
The names of the county and state in which the individual's spouse claims a deduction substantially similar to the deduction allowed by this section. 

(2) 
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the following are true: 

(A) 
That the individual and the individual's spouse maintain separate principal places of residence. 

(B) 
That neither the individual nor the individual's spouse has an ownership interest in the other's principal place of residence. 

(C) 
That neither the individual nor the individual's spouse has, for that same year, claimed a standard or substantially similar deduction for any property other than the property maintained as a principal place of residence by the 




respective individuals. A county auditor may require an individual or an individual's spouse to provide evidence of the accuracy of the information contained in an affidavit submitted under this subsection. The evidence required of the individual or the individual's spouse may include state income tax returns, excise tax payment information, property tax payment information, driver license information, and voter registration information. 
(o) If: 
(1) 
a property owner files a statement under subsection (e) to claim the deduction provided by this section for a particular property; and 

(2) 
the county auditor receiving the filed statement determines that the property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction; 


the county auditor shall inform the property owner of the county auditor's determination in writing. If a property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction because the county auditor has determined that the property is not the property owner's principal place of residence, the property owner may appeal the county auditor's determination to the county property tax assessment board of appeals as provided in IC 6-1.1-15. The county auditor shall inform the property owner of the owner's right to appeal to the county property tax assessment board of appeals when the county auditor informs the property owner of the county auditor's determination under this subsection. 
(p) An individual is entitled to the deduction under this section for a homestead for a particular assessment date if: 
(1) 
either: 

(A) 
the individual's interest in the homestead as described in subsection (a)(2)(B) is conveyed to the individual after the assessment date, but within the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs; or 

(B) 
the individual contracts to purchase the homestead after the assessment date, but within the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs; 



(2) 
on the assessment date: 

(A) 
the property on which the homestead is currently located was vacant land; or 

(B) 
the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed; 



(3) 
either: 

(A) 
the individual files the certified statement required by subsection (e) on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs to claim the deduction under this section; or 

(B) 
a sales disclosure form that meets the requirements of section 44 of this chapter is submitted to the county assessor 




on or before December 31 of the calendar year for the individual's purchase of the homestead; and 
(4) the individual files with the county auditor on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs a statement that: 
(A) 
lists any other property for which the individual would otherwise receive a deduction under this section for the assessment date; and 

(B) 
cancels the deduction described in clause (A) for that 


property. An individual who satisfies the requirements of subdivisions (1) through (4) is entitled to the deduction under this section for the homestead for the assessment date, even if on the assessment date the property on which the homestead is currently located was vacant land or the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed. The county auditor shall apply the deduction for the assessment date and for the assessment date in any later year in which the homestead remains eligible for the deduction. A homestead that qualifies for the deduction under this section as provided in this subsection is considered a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter and IC 6-1.1-20.6. The county auditor shall cancel the deduction under this section for any property that is located in the county and is listed on the statement filed by the individual under subdivision (4). If the property listed on the statement filed under subdivision (4) is located in another county, the county auditor who receives the statement shall forward the statement to the county auditor of that other county, and the county auditor of that other county shall cancel the deduction under this section for that property. 
(q) 
This subsection applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an individual buying a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property under a contract providing that the individual is to pay the property taxes on the mobile home or manufactured home is not entitled to the deduction provided by this section unless the parties to the contract comply with IC 9-17-6-17. 

(r) This subsection: 
(1) applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013; and 

(2) 
does not apply to an individual described in subsection (q). The owner of a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property must attach a copy of the owner's title to the mobile home or manufactured home to the application for the deduction provided by this section. 


(s) For assessment dates after 2013, the term "homestead" includes property that is owned by an individual who: 
(1) 
is serving on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States; 

(2) 
was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana; and 

(3) 
was otherwise eligible, without regard to this subsection, for the deduction under this section for the property for the assessment date immediately preceding the transfer date specified in the order described in subdivision (2). 


For property to qualify under this subsection for the deduction provided by this section, the individual described in subdivisions (1) through (3) must submit to the county auditor a copy of the individual's transfer orders or other information sufficient to show that the individual was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana. The property continues to qualify for the deduction provided by this section until the individual ceases to be on active duty, the property is sold, or the individual's ownership interest is otherwise terminated, whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), the property remains a homestead regardless of whether the property continues to be the individual's principal place of residence after the individual transfers to a location outside Indiana. However, the property ceases to qualify as a homestead under this subsection if the property is leased while the individual is away from Indiana. Property that qualifies as a homestead under this subsection shall also be construed as a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter.

An individual who fails to file the statement required by this subsection is liable for any additional taxes that would have been due on the property if the individual had filed the statement as required by this subsection plus a civil penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the additional taxes due. 
The civil penalty imposed under this subsection is in addition to any interest and penalties for a delinquent payment that might otherwise be due.

the applications claim the deduction for different property. 



(i) 
The department of local government finance shall provide secure access to county auditors to a homestead property data base that includes access to the homestead owner's name and the numbers required from the homestead owner under subsection (e)(4) for the sole purpose of verifying whether an owner is wrongly claiming a deduction under this chapter or a credit under IC 6-1.1-20.4, IC 6-1.1-20.6, or IC 6-3.6-5. 

(j) 
A county auditor may require an individual to provide evidence proving that the individual's residence is the individual's principal place of residence as claimed in the certified statement filed under subsection (e). The county auditor may limit the evidence that an individual is required to submit to a state income tax return, a valid driver's license, or a valid voter registration card showing that the residence for which the deduction is claimed is the individual's principal place of residence. The department of local government finance shall work with county auditors to develop procedures to determine whether a property owner that is claiming a standard deduction or homestead credit is not eligible for the standard deduction or homestead credit because the property owner's principal place of residence is outside Indiana. 

(k) 
As used in this section, "homestead" includes property that satisfies each of the following requirements:

(1) imposed for an assessment date in 2009; and 

(2) 
first due and payable in 2010; on the grounds that the property is not owned by an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B), the county auditor shall reinstate the deduction if the taxpayer provides proof that the property is eligible for the deduction in accordance with subsection (k) and that the individual residing on the property is not claiming the deduction for any other property. 

(m) 
For assessment dates after 2009, the term "homestead" includes: 

(1) 
a deck or patio;

that is assessed as real property and attached to the dwelling. 
(n) A county auditor shall grant an individual a deduction under this section regardless of whether the individual and the individual's spouse claim a deduction on two (2) different applications and each application claims a deduction for different property if the property owned by the individual's spouse is located outside Indiana and the individual files an affidavit with the county auditor containing the following information: 
(1) 
The names of the county and state in which the individual's spouse claims a deduction substantially similar to the deduction allowed by this section. 

(2) 
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the following are true:

The evidence required of the individual or the individual's spouse may include state income tax returns, excise tax payment information, property tax payment information, driver license information, and voter registration information. 
(o) If: 
(1) 
a property owner files a statement under subsection (e) to claim the deduction provided by this section for a particular property; and 

(2) 
the county auditor receiving the filed statement determines that the property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction; 


the county auditor shall inform the property owner of the county auditor's determination in writing. If a property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction because the county auditor has determined that the property is not the property owner's principal place of residence, the property owner may appeal the county auditor's determination to the county property tax assessment board of appeals as provided in IC 6-1.1-15. The county auditor shall inform the property owner of the owner's right to appeal to the county property tax assessment board of appeals when the county auditor informs the property owner of the county auditor's determination under this subsection.

the individual files the certified statement required by subsection (e); or 

(B) 
a sales disclosure form that meets the requirements of section 44 of this chapter is submitted to the county assessor on or before December 31 of the calendar year for the individual's purchase of the homestead. 




An individual who satisfies the requirements of subdivisions (1) through (3) is entitled to the deduction under this section for the homestead for the assessment date, even if on the assessment date the property on which the homestead is currently located was vacant land or the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed. The county auditor shall apply the deduction for the assessment date and for the assessment date in any later year in which the homestead remains eligible for the deduction. A homestead that qualifies for the deduction under this section as provided in this subsection is considered a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter and IC 6-1.1-20.6. 
(q) 
This subsection applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an individual buying a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property under a contract providing that the individual is to pay the property taxes on the mobile home or manufactured home is not entitled to the deduction provided by this section unless the parties to the contract comply with IC 9-17-6-17. 

(r) This subsection: 
(1) applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013; and 

(2) 
does not apply to an individual described in subsection (q).

is serving on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States; 

(2) 
was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana; and 

(3) 
was otherwise eligible, without regard to this subsection, for the deduction under this section for the property for the assessment date immediately preceding the transfer date specified in the order described in subdivision (2). 




For property to qualify under this subsection for the deduction provided by this section, the individual described in subdivisions (1) through (3) must submit to the county auditor a copy of the individual's transfer orders or other information sufficient to show that the individual was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana. The property continues to qualify for the deduction provided by this section until the individual ceases to be on active duty, the property is sold, or the individual's ownership interest is otherwise terminated, whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), the property remains a homestead regardless of whether the property continues to be the individual's principal place of residence after the individual transfers to a location outside Indiana. The property continues to qualify as a homestead under this subsection if the property is leased while the individual is away from Indiana and is serving on active duty, if the individual has lived at the property at any time during the past ten (10) years. Otherwise, the property ceases to qualify as a homestead under this subsection if the property is leased while the individual is away from Indiana. Property that qualifies as a homestead under this subsection shall also be construed as a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter.

that they use as their legal names when they sign their 


names on legal documents; 
if the applicant is an individual; or 

(B) each individual who qualifies property as a homestead under subsection (a)(2)(B) and the individual's spouse (if any): 
(i) 
as the names appear in the records of the United States Social Security Administration for the purposes of the issuance of a Social Security card and Social Security number; or

the United States government and determined by the 
department of local government finance to be acceptable. If a form or statement provided to the county auditor under this section, IC 6-1.1-22-8.1, or IC 6-1.1-22.5-12 includes the telephone number or part or all of the Social Security number of a party or other number described in subdivision (4)(B) of a party, the telephone number and the Social Security number or other number described in subdivision (4)(B) included are confidential. The statement may be filed in person or by mail. If the statement is mailed, the mailing must be postmarked on or before the last day for filing. The statement applies for that first year and any succeeding year for which the deduction is allowed. With respect to real property, the statement must be completed and dated in the calendar year for which the person desires to obtain the deduction and filed with the county auditor on or before January 5 of the immediately succeeding calendar year. With respect to a mobile home that is not assessed as real property, the person must file the statement during the twelve (12) months before March 31 of the year for which the person desires to obtain the deduction. 
(f) If an individual who is receiving the deduction provided by this section or who otherwise qualifies property for a deduction under this section: 
(1) 
changes the use of the individual's property so that part or all of the property no longer qualifies for the deduction under this section; or 

(2) 
is no longer eligible for a deduction under this section on another parcel of property because: 

(A) 
the individual would otherwise receive the benefit of more than one (1) deduction under this chapter; or 

(B) 
the individual maintains the individual's principal place of residence with another individual who receives a deduction under this section; 




the individual must file a certified statement with the auditor of the county, notifying the auditor of the change of use, not more than sixty (60) days after the date of that change. An individual who fails to file the statement required by this subsection is liable for any additional taxes that would have been due on the property if the individual had filed the statement as required by this subsection plus a civil penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the additional taxes due. The civil penalty imposed under this subsection is in addition to any interest and penalties for a delinquent payment that might otherwise be due. One percent (1%) of the total civil penalty collected under this subsection shall be transferred by the county to the department of local government finance for use by the department in establishing and maintaining the homestead property data base under subsection 
(i) 
and, to the extent there is money remaining, for any other purposes of the department. This amount becomes part of the 

property tax liability for purposes of this article. 

(g) 
The department of local government finance may adopt rules or guidelines concerning the application for a deduction under this section. 

(h) 
This subsection does not apply to property in the first year for which a deduction is claimed under this section if the sole reason that a deduction is claimed on other property is that the individual or married couple maintained a principal residence at the other property on the assessment date in the same year in which an application for a deduction is filed under this section or, if the application is for a homestead that is assessed as personal property, on the assessment date in the immediately preceding year and the individual or married couple is moving the individual's or married couple's principal residence to the property that is the subject of the application. Except as provided in subsection (n), the county auditor may not grant an individual or a married couple a deduction under this section if: 

(1) 
the individual or married couple, for the same year, claims the deduction on two (2) or more different applications for the deduction; and 

(2) 
the applications claim the deduction for different property. 



(i) 
The department of local government finance shall provide secure access to county auditors to a homestead property data base that includes access to the homestead owner's name and the numbers required from the homestead owner under subsection (e)(4) for the sole purpose of verifying whether an owner is wrongly claiming a deduction under this chapter or a credit under IC 6-1.1-20.4, IC 6-1.1-20.6, or IC 6-3.6-5 (after December 31, 2016). 

(j) 
A county auditor may require an individual to provide evidence proving that the individual's residence is the individual's principal place of residence as claimed in the certified statement filed under subsection (e). The county auditor may limit the evidence that an individual is required to submit to a state income tax return, a valid driver's license, or a valid voter registration card showing that the residence for which the deduction is claimed is the individual's principal place of residence. The department of local government finance shall work with county auditors to develop procedures to determine whether a property owner that is claiming a standard deduction or homestead credit is not eligible for the standard deduction or homestead credit because the property owner's principal place of residence is outside Indiana. 

(k) 
As used in this section, "homestead" includes property that satisfies each of the following requirements: 

(1) 
The property is located in Indiana and consists of a dwelling and the real estate, not exceeding one (1) acre, that immediately surrounds that dwelling. 

(2) 
The property is the principal place of residence of an individual. 

(3) 
The property is owned by an entity that is not described in 

subsection (a)(2)(B). 

(4) 
The individual residing on the property is a shareholder, partner, or member of the entity that owns the property. 

(5) 
The property was eligible for the standard deduction under this section on March 1, 2009. 



(l) 
If a county auditor terminates a deduction for property described in subsection (k) with respect to property taxes that are: 

(1) imposed for an assessment date in 2009; and 

(2) 
first due and payable in 2010; on the grounds that the property is not owned by an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B), the county auditor shall reinstate the deduction if the taxpayer provides proof that the property is eligible for the deduction in accordance with subsection (k) and that the individual residing on the property is not claiming the deduction for any other property. 

(m) 
For assessment dates after 2009, the term "homestead" includes: 

(1) 
a deck or patio; 

(2) 
a gazebo; or 

(3) 
another residential yard structure, as defined in rules that may be adopted by the department of local government finance (other than a swimming pool); 




that is assessed as real property and attached to the dwelling. 
(n) A county auditor shall grant an individual a deduction under this section regardless of whether the individual and the individual's spouse claim a deduction on two (2) different applications and each application claims a deduction for different property if the property owned by the individual's spouse is located outside Indiana and the individual files an affidavit with the county auditor containing the following information: 
(1) 
The names of the county and state in which the individual's spouse claims a deduction substantially similar to the deduction allowed by this section. 

(2) 
A statement made under penalty of perjury that the following are true: 

(A) 
That the individual and the individual's spouse maintain separate principal places of residence. 

(B) 
That neither the individual nor the individual's spouse has an ownership interest in the other's principal place of residence. 

(C) 
That neither the individual nor the individual's spouse has, for that same year, claimed a standard or substantially similar deduction for any property other than the property maintained as a principal place of residence by the respective individuals. 




A county auditor may require an individual or an individual's spouse to provide evidence of the accuracy of the information contained in an affidavit submitted under this subsection. The evidence required of the individual or the individual's spouse may include state income tax returns, excise tax payment information, property tax payment information, driver license information, and voter registration information. 
(o) If: 
(1) 
a property owner files a statement under subsection (e) to claim the deduction provided by this section for a particular property; and 

(2) 
the county auditor receiving the filed statement determines that the property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction; 


the county auditor shall inform the property owner of the county auditor's determination in writing. If a property owner's property is not eligible for the deduction because the county auditor has determined that the property is not the property owner's principal place of residence, the property owner may appeal the county auditor's determination to the county property tax assessment board of appeals as provided in IC 6-1.1-15. The county auditor shall inform the property owner of the owner's right to appeal to the county property tax assessment board of appeals when the county auditor informs the property owner of the county auditor's determination under this subsection. 
(p) An individual is entitled to the deduction under this section for a homestead for a particular assessment date if: 
(1) 
either: 

(A) 
the individual's interest in the homestead as described in subsection (a)(2)(B) is conveyed to the individual after the assessment date, but within the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs; or 

(B) 
the individual contracts to purchase the homestead after the assessment date, but within the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs; 



(2) 
on the assessment date: 

(A) 
the property on which the homestead is currently located was vacant land; or 

(B) 
the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed; 



(3) 
either: 

(A) 
the individual files the certified statement required by subsection (e) on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment date occurs to claim the deduction under this section; or 

(B) 
a sales disclosure form that meets the requirements of section 44 of this chapter is submitted to the county assessor on or before December 31 of the calendar year for the individual's purchase of the homestead; and 



(4) 
the individual files with the county auditor on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the assessment date 


occurs a statement that: 
(A) 
lists any other property for which the individual would otherwise receive a deduction under this section for the assessment date; and 

(B) 
cancels the deduction described in clause (A) for that 


property. An individual who satisfies the requirements of subdivisions (1) through (4) is entitled to the deduction under this section for the homestead for the assessment date, even if on the assessment date the property on which the homestead is currently located was vacant land or the construction of the dwelling that constitutes the homestead was not completed. The county auditor shall apply the deduction for the assessment date and for the assessment date in any later year in which the homestead remains eligible for the deduction. A homestead that qualifies for the deduction under this section as provided in this subsection is considered a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter and IC 6-1.1-20.6. The county auditor shall cancel the deduction under this section for any property that is located in the county and is listed on the statement filed by the individual under subdivision (4). If the property listed on the statement filed under subdivision (4) is located in another county, the county auditor who receives the statement shall forward the statement to the county auditor of that other county, and the county auditor of that other county shall cancel the deduction under this section for that property. 
(q) 
This subsection applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an individual buying a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property under a contract providing that the individual is to pay the property taxes on the mobile home or manufactured home is not entitled to the deduction provided by this section unless the parties to the contract comply with IC 9-17-6-17. 

(r) This subsection: 
(1) applies to an application for the deduction provided by this section that is filed for an assessment date occurring after December 31, 2013; and 

(2) 
does not apply to an individual described in subsection (q). The owner of a mobile home that is not assessed as real property or a manufactured home that is not assessed as real property must attach a copy of the owner's title to the mobile home or manufactured home to the application for the deduction provided by this section. 

(s) 
For assessment dates after 2013, the term "homestead" includes property that is owned by an individual who: 

(1) 
is serving on active duty in any branch of the armed forces of the United States; 

(2) 
was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana; and 

(3) 
was otherwise eligible, without regard to this subsection, for the deduction under this section for the property for the assessment date immediately preceding the transfer date specified in the order described in subdivision (2). 




For property to qualify under this subsection for the deduction provided by this section, the individual described in subdivisions (1) through (3) must submit to the county auditor a copy of the individual's transfer orders or other information sufficient to show that the individual was ordered to transfer to a location outside Indiana. The property continues to qualify for the deduction provided by this section until the individual ceases to be on active duty, the property is sold, or the individual's ownership interest is otherwise terminated, whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding subsection (a)(2), the property remains a homestead regardless of whether the property continues to be the individual's principal place of residence after the individual transfers to a location outside Indiana. However, the property ceases to qualify as a homestead under this subsection if the property is leased while the individual is away from Indiana. Property that qualifies as a homestead under this subsection shall also be construed as a homestead for purposes of section 37.5 of this chapter.

(b) 
In a county containing a consolidated city or within a city or town, a designating body may find that a particular area within its jurisdiction is a residentially distressed area.

However, in a city in a county having a population of more than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) but less than two hundred seventy thousand (270,000), the designating body is only required to make one (1) of the additional findings described in this subsection or one 

(1) 
of the additional findings described in subsection (c). 

(c) 
In a county containing a consolidated city or within a city or town, a designating body that wishes to designate a particular area a residentially distressed area may make the following additional findings as an alternative to the additional findings described in subsection (b): 

(1) 
A significant number of dwelling units within the area are not permanently occupied or a significant number of parcels in the area are vacant land. 

(2)

(3) 
The area has experienced a net loss in the number of dwelling units, as documented by census information, local building and demolition permits, or certificates of occupancy, or the area is owned by Indiana or the United States.

(2) 
If a designation application is filed, the designating body may require that the redevelopment or rehabilitation be completed within a reasonable period of time. 



(e)
 To make a designation described in subsection (a) or (b), the designating body shall use procedures prescribed in section 2.5 of this chapter. 

(f) 
The property tax deductions provided by section 3, 4.5, or 4.8 of this chapter are only available within an area which the designating body finds to be an economic revitalization area. 

(g) 
The designating body may adopt a resolution establishing general standards to be used, along with the requirements set forth in the definition of economic revitalization area, by the designating body in finding an area to be an economic revitalization area. The standards must have a reasonable relationship to the development objectives of the area in which the designating body has jurisdiction. The following four (4) sets of standards may be established: 

(1) 
One (1) relative to the deduction under section 3 of this chapter for economic revitalization areas that are not residentially distressed areas. 

(2) 
One (1) relative to the deduction under section 3 of this chapter for residentially distressed areas. 

(3) 
One (1) relative to the deduction allowed under section 4.5 of this chapter. 

(4) 
One (1) relative to the deduction allowed under section 4.8 of this chapter. 



(h) 
A designating body may impose a fee for filing a designation application for a person requesting the designation of a particular area as an economic revitalization area. The fee may be sufficient to defray actual processing and administrative costs. However, the fee 

charged for filing a designation application for a parcel that contains one (1) or more owner-occupied, single-family dwellings may not exceed the cost of publishing the required notice. 

(i) 
In declaring an area an economic revitalization area, the designating body may: 

(1) 
limit the time period to a certain number of calendar years during which the economic revitalization area shall be so designated; 

(2) 
limit the type of deductions that will be allowed within the economic revitalization area to the deduction allowed under section 3 of this chapter, the deduction allowed under section 




4.5 of this chapter, the deduction allowed under section 4.8 of this chapter, or any combination of these deductions; 
(3) 
limit the dollar amount of the deduction that will be allowed with respect to new manufacturing equipment, new research and development equipment, new logistical distribution equipment, and new information technology equipment; 

(4) 
limit the dollar amount of the deduction that will be allowed with respect to redevelopment and rehabilitation occurring in areas that are designated as economic revitalization areas; 

(5) 
limit the dollar amount of the deduction that will be allowed under section 4.8 of this chapter with respect to the occupation of an eligible vacant building; or 

(6) 
impose reasonable conditions related to the purpose of this chapter or to the general standards adopted under subsection (g) for allowing the deduction for the redevelopment or rehabilitation of the property or the installation of the new manufacturing equipment, new research and development equipment, new logistical distribution equipment, or new information technology equipment. 


To exercise one (1) or more of these powers, a designating body must include this fact in the resolution passed under section 2.5 of this chapter. 
(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a designating body limits the time period during which an area is an economic revitalization area, that limitation does not: 
(1) 
prevent a taxpayer from obtaining a deduction for new manufacturing equipment, new research and development equipment, new logistical distribution equipment, or new information technology equipment installed on or before the approval deadline determined under section 9 of this chapter, but after the expiration of the economic revitalization area if the new manufacturing equipment, new research and development equipment, new logistical distribution equipment, or new information technologyequipment was described in a statement of benefits submitted to and approved by the designating body in accordance with section 4.5 of this chapter before the expiration of the economic revitalization area designation; or 

(2) 
limit the length of time a taxpayer is entitled to receive a deduction to a number of years that is less than the number of years designated under section 17 of this chapter. 


(k) In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, if property located in an economic revitalization area is also located in an allocation area (as defined in IC 36-7-14-39 or IC 36-7-15.1-26), a taxpayer's statement of benefits concerning that property may not be approved under this chapter unless a resolution approving the statement of benefits is adopted by the legislative body of the unit that approved the designation of the allocation area.

(b) 
After the compilation of the materials described in subsection (a), the designating body shall pass a resolution declaring the area an economic revitalization area. The resolution must contain a description of the affected area and be filed with the county assessor. A resolution may include a determination of the number of years a deduction under section 3, 4.5, or 4.8 of this chapter is allowed.

The notice must state that a description of the affected area is available and can be inspected in the county assessor's office. The notice must also name a date when the designating body will receive and hear all remonstrances and objections from interested persons. The designating body shall file the information required by subdivision (2) with the officers of the taxing unit who are authorized to fix budgets, tax rates, and tax levies under IC 6-1.1-17-5 at least ten (10) days before the date of the public hearing. After considering the evidence, the designating body shall take final action determining whether the qualifications for an economic revitalization area have been met and confirming, modifying and confirming, or rescinding the resolution. This determination is final except that an appeal may be taken and heard as provided under subsections (d) and (e). 
(d) A person who filed a written remonstrance with the designating body under this section and who is aggrieved by the final action taken may, within ten (10) days after that final action, initiate an appeal of that action by filing in the office of the clerk of the circuit or superior court a copy of the order of the designating body and the person's remonstrance against that order, together with the person's bond conditioned to pay the costs of the person's appeal if the appeal is determined against the person. The only ground of appeal that the court may hear is whether the proposed project will meet the qualifications of the economic revitalization area law. The burden of proof is on the appellant. 
(e) An appeal under this section shall be promptly heard by the court without a jury. All remonstrances upon which an appeal has been taken shall be consolidated and heard and determined within thirty (30) days after the time of the filing of the appeal.

rehabilitation. With the approval of the designating body, the statement of benefits may be incorporated in a designation application. Notwithstanding any other law, a statement of benefits is a public record that may be inspected and copied under IC 5-14-3-3. 
(b) The designating body must review the statement of benefits required under subsection (a). The designating body shall determine whether an area should be designated an economic revitalization area or whether a deduction should be allowed, based on (and after it has made) the following findings: 
(1) 
Whether the estimate of the value of the redevelopment or rehabilitation is reasonable for projects of that nature. 

(2) 
Whether the estimate of the number of individuals who will be employed or whose employment will be retained can be reasonably expected to result from the proposed described redevelopment or rehabilitation. 

(3) 
Whether the estimate of the annual salaries of those individuals who will be employed or whose employment will be retained can be reasonably expected to result from the proposed described redevelopment or rehabilitation. 

(4) 
Whether any other benefits about which information was requested are benefits that can be reasonably expected to result from the proposed described redevelopment or rehabilitation.

(2) 
petition for judicial review under section 5 of this chapter. 



(j)

Findings of ultimate fact must be accompanied by a concise statement of the underlying basic facts of record to support the findings. Findings must be based exclusively upon the evidence on the record in the proceeding and on matters officially noticed in the proceeding. Findings must be based upon a preponderance of the evidence. 

(k) 
The Indiana board may limit the scope of the appeal to the issues raised in the petition and the evaluation of the evidence presented to the county board in support of those issues only if all parties participating in the hearing required under subsection (a) agree to the limitation. A party participating in the hearing required under subsection (a) is entitled to introduce evidence that is otherwise proper and admissible without regard to whether that evidence has previously been introduced at a hearing before the county board.

(p) At a hearing under this section, the Indiana board shall admit into evidence an appraisal report, prepared by an appraiser, unless the appraisal report is ruled inadmissible on grounds besides a hearsay objection. This exception to the hearsay rule shall not be construed to limit the discretion of the Indiana board, as trier of fact, to review the probative value of an appraisal report.

Failure to grant a rehearing not later than fifteen (15) days after receiving the petition shall be treated as a final determination to deny the petition.

If the Indiana board determines to rehear a final determination, the Indiana board: 
(1) 
may conduct the additional hearings that the Indiana board determines necessary or review the written record without additional hearings; and

(c)
 Except as provided in subsection (g), to initiate a proceeding for judicial review under this section, a party must take the action required by subsection (b) not later than:

(d) 
The failure of the Indiana board to conduct a hearing within the period prescribed in section 4(e) or 4(f) of this chapter does not constitute notice to the party of an Indiana board final determination.

Sec. 10. (a) If a petition for review to any board or a proceeding for judicial review in the tax court regarding an assessment or increase in assessment is pending, the taxes resulting from the assessment or increase in assessment are, notwithstanding the provisions of IC 6-1.1-22-9, not due until after the petition for review, or the proceeding for judicial review, is finally adjudicated and the assessment or increase in assessment is finally determined. However, even though a petition for review or a proceeding for judicial review is pending, the taxpayer shall pay taxes on the tangible property when the property tax installments come due, unless the collection of the taxes is enjoined under IC 33-26-6-2 pending a final determination in the proceeding for judicial review. The amount of taxes which the taxpayer is required to pay, pending the final determination of the assessment or increase in assessment, shall be based on: 
(1) 
the assessed value reported by the taxpayer on the taxpayer's personal property return if a personal property assessment, or an increase in such an assessment, is involved; or 

(2) 
an amount based on the immediately preceding year's assessment of real property if an assessment, or increase in assessment, of real property is involved. 


(b) If the petition for review or the proceeding for judicial review is not finally determined by the last installment date for the taxes, the taxpayer, upon showing of cause by a taxing official or at the tax court's discretion, may be required to post a bond or provide other security in an amount not to exceed the taxes resulting from the contested assessment or increase in assessment. 
(c) Each county auditor shall keep separate on the tax duplicate a record of that portion of the assessed value of property that is described in IC 6-1.1-17-0.5(b). When establishing rates and calculating state school support, the department of local government finance shall exclude from assessed value in the county the net assessed value of property kept separate on the tax duplicate by the county auditor under IC 6-1.1-17-0.5.

In calculating the change in the assessment for purposes of this section, the assessment to be used for the prior tax year is the original assessment for that prior tax year or, if applicable, the assessment for that prior tax year: 
(1) 
as last corrected by an assessing official; 

(2) 
as stipulated or settled by the taxpayer and the assessing official; or 

(3) 
as determined by the reviewing authority. 


(b) Under this section, the county assessor or township assessor making the assessment has the burden of proving that the assessment is correct in any review or appeal under this chapter and in any appeals taken to the Indiana board of tax review or to the Indiana tax court.

the amount originally advertised or adopted by the political subdivision if: 
(1) 
the increase is requested in writing by the officers of the political subdivision; 

(2) 
the requested increase is published on the department's advertising Internet web site and (before January 1, 2015) is published by the political subdivision according to a notice provided by the department; and 

(3) 
notice is given to the county fiscal body of the error and the 


department's correction.

Sec. 22. (a) In determining the amount of the levy for a debt service fund for a budget year, the maximum amount allowed for an operating balance in the debt service fund is the sum of the maximum allowable operating balance for each debt included in the debt service fund.

(1) 
For debt originally incurred after June 30, 2014, the lesser of:

(b) For purposes of IC 6-1.1-20.6-9.5, the property taxes allowed for an operating balance in the debt service fund under this section may not be construed as an increase in a political subdivision's property tax levy to make up for a reduction in property tax collections resulting from the application of credits under IC 6-1.1-20.6.

The notice shall state the time and place at which a public hearing will be held on the proposal. The notice shall be given once in accordance with IC 5-3-1-2(b). 
(b) 
If the additional appropriation by the political subdivision is made from a fund that receives: 

(1) distributions from the motor vehicle highway account established under IC 8-14-1-1 or the local road and street account established under IC 8-14-2-4; or 

(2) 
revenue from property taxes levied under IC 6-1.1; the political subdivision must report the additional appropriation to the department of local government finance. If the additional appropriation is made from a fund described under this subsection, subsections (f), (g), (h), and (i) apply to the political subdivision. 

(c) 
However, if the additional appropriation is not made from a fund described under subsection (b), subsections (f), (g), (h), and (i) do not apply to the political subdivision. Subsections (f), (g), (h), and 

(i) 
do not apply to an additional appropriation made from the cumulative bridge fund if the appropriation meets the requirements under IC 8-16-3-3(c). 

(d) 
A political subdivision may make an additional appropriation without approval of the department of local government finance if the additional appropriation is made from a fund that is not described under subsection (b). However, the fiscal officer of the political subdivision shall report the additional appropriation to the department of local government finance. 

(e) 
After the public hearing, the proper officers of the political subdivision shall file a certified copy of their final proposal and any other relevant information to the department of local government finance. 

(f)
 When the department of local government finance receives a certified copy of a proposal for an additional appropriation under subsection (e), the department shall determine whether sufficient funds are available or will be available for the proposal. The determination shall be made in writing and sent to the political subdivision not more than fifteen (15) days after the department of local government finance receives the proposal. 

(g) 
In making the determination under subsection (f), the department of local government finance shall limit the amount of the additional appropriation to revenues available, or to be made available, which have not been previously appropriated. 

(h) 
If the department of local government finance disapproves an additional appropriation under subsection (f), the department shall specify the reason for its disapproval on the determination sent to the political subdivision. 

(i) 
A political subdivision may request a reconsideration of a determination of the department of local government finance under this section by filing a written request for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration must: 


(1) be filed with the department of local government finance within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the determination by the political subdivision; and 
(2) 
state with reasonable specificity the reason for the request. The department of local government finance must act on a request for reconsideration within fifteen (15) days of receiving the request.

(1) 
they determine that the transfer is necessary; 

(2) 
the transfer does not require the expenditure of more money than the total amount set out in the budget as finally determined under this article; and 

(3) 
the transfer is made at a regular public meeting and by proper ordinance or resolution.

(2) 
the funds have been appropriated by the proper officers of the political subdivision in the amounts and for the specific purposes for which they may be used.

(c) In the event of a casualty, accident, or extraordinary emergency, the proper officers of a political subdivision may use state funds to make an additional appropriation under section 5 of this chapter. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) 
IC 6-1.1-18-9 Reappropriations from erroneous or excessive disbursements; refunds without appropriation 
Sec. 9. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the proper officer or officers of a political subdivision may:

(e) 
For property tax rates imposed for property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2013, the new maximum rate under a statute listed in subsection (d) is the tax rate determined under STEP EIGHT of the following STEPS: 


STEP ONE: Except as provided in subsection (g), determine the maximum rate for the political subdivision levying a property tax or special benefits tax under the statute for the previous calendar year. STEP TWO: Determine the actual percentage change (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth percent (0.01%)) in the assessed value of the taxable property from the previous calendar year to 
the year in which the affected property taxes will be imposed. 
STEP THREE: Determine the three (3) calendar years that 
immediately precede the year in which the affected property 
taxes will be imposed. 
STEP FOUR: Compute separately, for each of the calendar 
years determined in STEP THREE, the actual percentage 
change (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth percent (0.01%)) 
in the assessed value (before the adjustment, if any, under 
IC 6-1.1-4-4.5) of the taxable property from the preceding year. 
STEP FIVE: Divide the sum of the three (3) quotients computed 
in STEP FOUR by three (3). 
STEP SIX: Determine the greater of the following: 

(A) Zero (0). 
(B) The STEP FIVE result. STEP SEVEN: Determine the greater of the following: 
(A) 
Zero (0). 

(B) 
The result of the STEP TWO percentage minus the 


STEP SIX percentage, if any. STEP EIGHT: Determine the quotient of the STEP ONE tax rate divided by the sum of one (1) plus the STEP SEVEN percentage, if any. 
(f) 
The department of local government finance shall compute the maximum rate allowed under subsection (e) and provide the rate to each political subdivision with authority to levy a tax under a statute listed in subsection (d). 

(g)
 This subsection applies only when calculating the maximum rate for taxes due and payable in calendar year 2013. The STEP ONE result is the greater of the following: 

(1) 
The actual maximum rate established for property taxes first due and payable in calendar year 2012.

(h) 
This subsection applies only when calculating the maximum rate allowed under subsection (e) for the Vincennes Community School Corporation with respect to property taxes first due and payable in 2014.

(i) 
This subsection does not apply when calculating the maximum rate for the Vincennes Community School Corporation. This subsection applies only when calculating the maximum rate for a school corporation's capital projects fund for taxes due and payable in calendar year 2016.

Sec. 10.5. (a) The ad valorem property tax levy limits imposed by section 3 of this chapter do not apply to ad valorem property taxes imposed by a civil taxing unit for fire protection services within a fire protection territory under IC 36-8-19, if the civil taxing unit is a participating unit in a fire protection territory established before August 1, 2001. For purposes of computing the ad valorem property tax levy limits imposed on a civil taxing unit by section 3 of this chapter on a civil taxing unit that is a participating unit in a fire protection territory, established before August 1, 2001, the civil taxing unit's ad valorem property tax levy for a particular calendar year does not include that part of the levy imposed under IC 36-8-19.

(b) 
The department of local government finance may, under this subsection, increase the maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy that would otherwise apply to a civil taxing unit under section 3 of this chapter to meet the civil taxing unit's obligations to a fire protection territory established under IC 36-8-19. To obtain an increase in the civil taxing unit's maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy, a civil taxing unit shall submit a petition to the department of local government finance in the year immediately preceding the first year in which the civil taxing unit levies a tax to support the fire protection territory. The petition must be filed before the date specified in section 12(a)(1) of this chapter of that year. The department of local government finance shall make a final determination of the civil taxing unit's budget, ad valorem property tax levy, and property tax rate for the fire protection territory for the ensuing calendar year. In making its determination under this subsection, the department of local government finance shall consider the amount that the civil taxing unit is obligated to provide to meet the expenses of operation and maintenance of the fire protection services within the territory, including the participating unit's reasonable share of an operating balance for the fire protection territory. The department of local government finance shall determine the entire amount of the allowable adjustment in the final determination. The department shall order the adjustment implemented in the amounts and over the number of years, not exceeding three (3), requested by the petitioning civil taxing unit. 

However, the department of local government finance may not approve under this subsection a property tax levy greater than zero 

(0) 
if the civil taxing unit did not exist as of the assessment date for which the tax levy will be imposed. For purposes of applying this subsection to the civil taxing unit's maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy in subsequent calendar years, the department of local government finance may determine not to consider part or all of the part of the property tax levy imposed to establish the operating balance of the fire protection territory.

(1) 
before October 20 of the calendar year immediately preceding the ensuing calendar year; or 

(2) 
in the case of a request described in section 16 of this chapter, before December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the ensuing calendar year; 


appeal to the department of local government finance for relief from those levy limitations. In the appeal the civil taxing unit must state that it will be unable to carry out the governmental functions committed to it by law unless it is given the authority that it is petitioning for. The civil taxing unit must support these allegations by reasonably detailed statements of fact. 
(b) 
The department of local government finance shall immediately proceed to the examination and consideration of the merits of the civil taxing unit's appeal. 

(c) 
In considering an appeal, the department of local government finance has the power to conduct hearings, require any officer or member of the appealing civil taxing unit to appear before it, or require any officer or member of the appealing civil taxing unit to provide the department with any relevant records or books. 


(d) If an officer or member:

(e) 
Upon the filing of an affidavit under subsection (d), the court shall promptly issue a summons, and the sheriff of the county within which the court is sitting shall serve the summons. The summons must command the officer or member to appear before the department to provide information to the department or to produce books and records for the department's use, as the case may be. Disobedience of the summons constitutes, and is punishable as, a contempt of the court that issued the summons. 

(f) 
All expenses incident to the filing of an affidavit under subsection (d) and the issuance and service of a summons shall be charged to the officer or member against whom the summons is issued, unless the court finds that the officer or member was acting in good faith and with reasonable cause. If the court finds that the officer or member was acting in good faith and with reasonable cause or if an affidavit is filed and no summons is issued, the expenses shall be charged against the county in which the affidavit was filed and shall be allowed by the proper fiscal officers of that county. 


(g) The fiscal officer of a civil taxing unit that appeals under section 16 of this chapter for relief from levy limitations shall immediately file a copy of the appeal petition with the county auditor and the county treasurer of the county in which the unit is located.

STEP ONE: Determine the three (3) calendar years that most immediately precede the ensuing calendar year and in which a statewide general reassessment of real property under IC 6-1.1-4-4 does not first become effective. STEP TWO: Compute separately, for each of the calendar years determined in STEP ONE, the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth (0.0001)) of the sum of the civil taxing unit's total assessed value of all taxable property and:

divided by the sum determined under this STEP for the calendar year immediately preceding the particular calendar year. STEP THREE: Divide the sum of the three (3) quotients computed in STEP TWO by three (3). STEP FOUR: Compute separately, for each of the calendar years determined in STEP ONE, the quotient (rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth (0.0001)) of the sum of the total assessed value of all taxable property in all counties and: 
(i) 
for a particular calendar year before 2007, the total assessed value of property tax deductions in all counties under IC 6-1.1-12-41 (repealed) or IC 6-1.1-12-42 in the particular calendar year; or

divided by the sum determined under this STEP for the calendar year immediately preceding the particular calendar year. STEP FIVE: Divide the sum of the three (3) quotients computed in STEP FOUR by three (3). STEP SIX: Divide the STEP THREE amount by the STEP FIVE amount. 
The civil taxing unit may increase its levy by a percentage not greater than the percentage by which the STEP THREE amount exceeds the percentage by which the civil taxing unit may increase its levy under section 3 of this chapter based on the assessed value growth quotient determined under section 2 of this chapter. 
(3) A levy increase may be granted under this subdivision only for property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2008.

(A) 
the total amount of state funds received in 2009 by the city and used to pay benefits to members of the 1925 police pension fund (IC 36-8-6) or the 1937 firefighters' pension fund (IC 36-8-7); plus

(1) 
Permission to the civil taxing unit to increase its levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter, if in the judgment of the department the increase is reasonably necessary due to increased costs of the civil taxing unit resulting from annexation, consolidation, or other extensions of governmental services by the civil taxing unit to additional geographic areas or persons. With respect to annexation, consolidation, or other extensions of governmental services in a calendar year, if those increased costs are incurred by the civil taxing unit in that calendar year and more than one 

(1) 
immediately succeeding calendar year, the unit may appeal under section 12 of this chapter for permission to increase its levy under this subdivision based on those increased costs in any of the following:

Before recommending such an increase, the local government tax control board shall consider all other revenues available to the civil taxing unit that could be applied for that purpose. The maximum aggregate levy 


increases that the local government tax control board may recommend for a particular court equals the civil taxing unit's estimate of the unit's share of the costs of operating a court for the first full calendar year in which it is in existence.

(i) 
for a particular calendar year before 2007, the total assessed value of property tax deductions in the unit under IC 6-1.1-12-41 (repealed) or IC 6-1.1-12-42 in the particular calendar year; or

(4) 
A levy increase may not be granted under this subdivision for property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2008. Permission to the civil taxing unit to increase its levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter, if the local government tax control board finds that the civil taxing unit needs the increase to pay the costs of furnishing fire protection for the civil taxing unit through a volunteer fire department. For purposes of determining a township's need for an increased levy, the local government tax control board shall not consider the amount of money borrowed under IC 36-6-6-14 during the immediately preceding calendar year. However, any increase in the amount of the civil taxing unit's levy recommended by the local government tax control board under this subdivision for the ensuing calendar year may not exceed the lesser of: 

(A) 
ten thousand dollars ($10,000); or 

(B) 
twenty percent (20%) of:

contributions the civil taxing unit is required to make under IC 36-8. The maximum increase in a civil taxing unit's levy that may be recommended under this subdivision for an ensuing calendar year equals the amount, if any, by which the pension payments and contributions the civil taxing unit is required to make under IC 36-8 during the ensuing calendar year exceeds the product of one and one-tenth (1.1) multiplied by the pension payments and contributions made by the civil taxing unit under IC 36-8 during the calendar year that immediately precedes the ensuing calendar year. For purposes of this subdivision, "pension payments and contributions made by a civil taxing unit" does not include that part of the payments or contributions that are funded by distributions made to a civil taxing unit by the state. 

(6) 
A levy increase may not be granted under this subdivision for property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2008. Permission to increase its levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter if the local government tax control board finds that: 

(A) 
the township's township assistance ad valorem property tax rate is less than one and sixty-seven hundredths cents ($0.0167) per one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation; and 

(B) 
the township needs the increase to meet the costs of providing township assistance under IC 12-20 and IC 12-30-4. 




The maximum increase that the board may recommend for a township is the levy that would result from an increase in the township's township assistance ad valorem property tax rate of one and sixty-seven hundredths cents ($0.0167) per one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation minus the township's ad valorem property tax rate per one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation before the increase.

the increase has been approved by the legislative body of the municipality with the largest population where the civil taxing unit provides public transportation services; and 

(B) 
the local government tax control board finds that the civil taxing unit needs the increase to provide adequate public transportation services. 


The local government tax control board shall consider tax rates and levies in civil taxing units of comparable population, and the effect (if any) of a loss of federal or other funds to the civil taxing unit that might have been used for public transportation purposes. However, the increase that the board may recommend under this subdivision for a civil taxing unit may not exceed the revenue that would be raised by the civil taxing unit based on a property tax rate of one cent ($0.01) per one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation. 
(8) A levy increase may not be granted under this subdivision for property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2008. Permission to a civil taxing unit to increase the unit's levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter if the local government tax control board finds that:

(i) 
a county having a population of more than one hundred seventy thousand (170,000) but less than one hundred seventy-five thousand (175,000); 

(ii) 
a city having a population of more than sixty-five thousand (65,000) but less than seventy thousand (70,000); 


(iii) a city having a population of more than twenty-nine thousand five hundred (29,500) but less than twenty-nine thousand six hundred (29,600);

The maximum increase that the local government tax control board may recommend for such a civil taxing unit is the levy that would result from a property tax rate of six and sixty-seven hundredths cents ($0.0667) for each one hundred dollars ($100) of assessed valuation. For purposes of computing the ad valorem property tax levy limit imposed on a civil taxing unit under section 3 of this chapter, the civil taxing unit's ad valorem property tax levy for a particular year does not include that part of the levy imposed under this subdivision. In addition, a property tax increase permitted under this subdivision may be imposed for only two (2) calendar years.

under section 3 of this chapter, if the local government tax control board finds that the county needs the increase to meet the county's share of the costs of operating a jail or juvenile detention center, including expansion of the facility, if the jail or juvenile detention center is opened after December 31, 1991; 

(B) 
that operates a county jail or juvenile detention center that is subject to an order that: 

(i)
 was issued by a federal district court; and 

(ii) 
has not been terminated; 



(C) 
that operates a county jail that fails to meet: 

(i) 
American Correctional Association Jail Construction Standards; and 

(ii) 
Indiana jail operation standards adopted by the department of correction; or 



(D) 
that operates a juvenile detention center that fails to meet standards equivalent to the standards described in clause (C) for the operation of juvenile detention centers. 


Before recommending an increase, the local government tax control board shall consider all other revenues available to the county that could be applied for that purpose. An appeal for operating funds for a jail or a juvenile detention center shall be considered individually, if a jail and juvenile detention center are both opened in one (1) county. The maximum aggregate levy increases that the local government tax control board may recommend for a county equals the county's share of the costs of operating the jail or a juvenile detention center for the first full calendar year in which the jail or juvenile detention center is in operation. 
(10) 
A levy increase may not be granted under this subdivision for property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2008. Permission for a township to increase its levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter, if the local government tax control board finds that the township needs the increase so that the property tax rate to pay the costs of furnishing fire protection for a township, or a portion of a township, enables the township to pay a fair and reasonable amount under a contract with the municipality that is furnishing the fire protection. However, for the first time an appeal is granted the resulting rate increase may not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the difference between the rate imposed for fire protection within the municipality that is providing the fire protection to the township and the township's rate. A township is required to appeal a second time for an increase under this subdivision if the township wants to further increase its rate. However, a township's rate may be increased to equal but may not exceed the rate that is used by the municipality. More than one (1) township served by the same municipality may use this 

appeal. 

(11) 
Permission to a city having a population of more than thirty-one thousand five hundred (31,500) but less than thirty-one thousand seven hundred twenty-five (31,725) to increase its levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter if: 

(A) 
an appeal was granted to the city under this section to reallocate property tax replacement credits under IC 6-3.5-1.1 (repealed) in 1998, 1999, and 2000; and 

(B) 
the increase has been approved by the legislative body of the city, and the legislative body of the city has by resolution determined that the increase is necessary to pay normal operating expenses. 




The maximum amount of the increase is equal to the amount of property tax replacement credits under IC 6-3.5-1.1 (repealed) that the city petitioned under this section to have reallocated in 2001 for a purpose other than property tax relief. 
(12) 
A levy increase may be granted under this subdivision only for property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2008. Permission to a civil taxing unit to increase its levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter if the civil taxing unit cannot carry out its governmental functions for an ensuing calendar year under the levy limitations imposed by section 3 of this chapter due to a natural disaster, an accident, or another unanticipated emergency. 

(13) 
Permission to Jefferson County to increase its levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter if the department finds that the county experienced a property tax revenue shortfall that resulted from an erroneous estimate of the effect of the supplemental deduction under IC 6-1.1-12-37.5 on the county's assessed valuation. An appeal for a levy increase under this subdivision may not be denied because of the amount of cash balances in county funds. The maximum increase in the county's levy that may be approved under this subdivision is three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000). 


(b) 
The department of local government finance shall increase the maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy under section 3 of this chapter for the city of Goshen for 2012 and thereafter by an amount equal to the greater of zero (0) or the result of: 

(1) 
the city's total pension costs in 2009 for the 1925 police pension fund (IC 36-8-6) and the 1937 firefighters' pension fund (IC 36-8-7); minus 

(2) 
the sum of: 

(A) 
the total amount of state funds received in 2009 by the city and used to pay benefits to members of the 1925 police pension fund (IC 36-8-6) or the 1937 firefighters' pension fund (IC 36-8-7); plus 

(B) 
any previous permanent increases to the city's levy that were authorized to account for the transfer to the state of the responsibility to pay benefits to members of the 1925 police pension fund (IC 36-8-6) and the 1937 firefighters' pension fund (IC 36-8-7). 





(c) 
In calendar year 2013, the department of local government finance shall allow a township to increase its maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy in excess of the limitations established under section 3 of this chapter, if the township: 

(1) 
petitions the department for the levy increase on a form prescribed by the department; and 

(2) 
submits proof of the amount borrowed in 2012 or 2013, but not both, under IC 36-6-6-14 to furnish fire protection for the township or a part of the township. 




The maximum increase in a township's levy that may be allowed under this subsection is the amount borrowed by the township under IC 36-6-6-14 in the year for which proof was submitted under subdivision (2). An increase allowed under this subsection applies to property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2013.

The department of local government finance may on its own initiative correct such an advertising error, mathematical error, or error in data for any civil taxing unit. 
(b) A correction made under subsection (a) for a prior calendar year shall be applied to the civil taxing unit's levy limitations, rate, and levy for the ensuing calendar year to offset any cumulative effect that the error caused in the determination of the civil taxing unit's levy limitations, rate, or levy for the ensuing calendar year.

IC 6-1.1-18.5-16 Civil taxing unit appeal to department of local government finance for relief from levy limits related to revenue shortfall related to erroneous assessed valuation 
Sec. 16. (a) A civil taxing unit may request permission from the department to impose an ad valorem property tax levy that exceeds the limits imposed by section 3 of this chapter if: 
(1) 
the civil taxing unit experienced a property tax revenue shortfall that resulted fromerroneous assessed valuation figures being provided to the civil taxing unit; 

(2) 
the erroneous assessed valuation figures were used by the civil taxing unit in determining its total property tax rate; and 

(3) 
the error in the assessed valuation figures was found after the civil taxing unit's property tax levy resulting from that total rate was finally approved by the department of local government finance. 


(b) 
A civil taxing unit may request permission from the department to impose an ad valorem property tax levy that exceeds the limits imposed by section 3 of this chapter if the civil taxing unit experienced a property tax revenue shortfall because of the payment of refunds that resulted from appeals under this article and IC 6-1.5. 

(c) 
If the department determines that a shortfall described in subsection (a) or (b) has occurred, the department of local government finance may find that the civil taxing unit should be allowed to impose a property tax levy exceeding the limit imposed by section 3 of this chapter. However, the maximum amount by which the civil taxing unit's levy may be increased over the limits imposed by section 3 of this chapter equals the remainder of the civil taxing unit's property tax levy for the particular calendar year as finally approved by the department of local government finance minus the actual property tax levy collected by the civil taxing unit for that particular calendar year. 

(d) 
Any property taxes collected by a civil taxing unit over the limits imposed by section 3 of this chapter under the authority of this section may not be treated as a part of the civil taxing unit's maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy for purposes of determining its maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy for future years. 

(e) 
If the department of local government finance authorizes an excess tax levy under this section, it shall take appropriate steps to 


insure that the proceeds are first used to repay any loan made to the civil taxing unit for the purpose of meeting its current expenses.

IC 6-1.1-18.5-17 Civil taxing unit levy excess fund; use of fund 
Sec. 17. (a) As used in this section, "levy excess" means the part of the ad valorem property tax levy actually collected by a civil taxing unit, for taxes first due and payable during a particular calendar year, that exceeds the civil taxing unit's ad valorem property tax levy, as approved by the department of local government finance under IC 6-1.1-17. The term does not include delinquent ad valorem property taxes collected during a particular year that were assessed for an assessment date that precedes the assessment date for the current year in which the ad valorem property taxes are collected. 
(b) 
A civil taxing unit's levy excess is valid and may not be contested on the grounds that it exceeds the civil taxing unit's levy limit for the applicable calendar year. However, the civil taxing unit shall deposit, except as provided in subsections (h) and (i), its levy excess in a special fund to be known as the civil taxing unit's levy excess fund. 

(c) 
The chief fiscal officer of a civil taxing unit may invest money in the civil taxing unit's levy excess fund in the same manner in which money in the civil taxing unit's general fund may be invested. However, any income derived from investment of the money shall be deposited in and becomes a part of the levy excess fund. 

(d) 
The department of local government finance shall require a civil taxing unit to include the amount in its levy excess fund in the civil taxing unit's budget fixed under IC 6-1.1-17. 

(e) 
Except as provided by subsection (f), a civil taxing unit may not spend any money in its levy excess fund until the expenditure of the money has been included in a budget that has been approved by the department of local government finance under IC 6-1.1-17. For purposes of fixing its budget and for purposes of the ad valorem property tax levy limits imposed under this chapter, a civil taxing unit shall treat the money in its levy excess fund that the department of local government finance permits it to spend during a particular calendar year as part of its ad valorem property tax levy for that same calendar year. 

(f) 
A civil taxing unit may transfer money from its levy excess fund to its other funds to reimburse those funds for amounts withheld from the civil taxing unit as a result of refunds paid under IC 6-1.1-26. 

(g) 
Subject to the limitations imposed by this section, a civil taxing unit may use money in its levy excess fund for any lawful 

purpose for which money in any of its other funds may be used. 

(h) 
If the amount that would, notwithstanding this subsection, be deposited in the levy excess fund of a civil taxing unit for a particular calendar year is less than one hundred dollars ($100), no money shall be deposited in the levy excess fund of the unit for that year. 


(i) This subsection applies only to a civil taxing unit that: 
(1) 
has a levy excess for a particular calendar year; 

(2) 
in the preceding calendar year experienced a shortfall in property tax collections below the civil taxing unit's property tax levy approved by the department of local government finance under IC 6-1.1-17; and 

(3) 
did not receive permission from the department to impose, because of the shortfall in property tax collections in the preceding calendar year, a property tax levy that exceeds the limits imposed by section 3 of this chapter. 


The amount that a civil taxing unit subject to this subsection must transfer to the civil taxing unit's levy excess fund in the calendar year in which the excess is collected shall be reduced by the amount of the civil taxing unit's shortfall in property tax collections in the preceding calendar year (but the reduction may not exceed the amount of the civil taxing unit's levy excess).

IC 6-1.1-18.5-19 Levy limit on taxes for township firefighting fund 
Sec. 19. (a) If a township levied an ad valorem property tax levy for a township firefighting fund under IC 36-8-13-4 for calendar year 1989, the maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy that will apply to the township's firefighting fund under section 3 of this chapter for calendar year 1990 is the amount determined in STEP FIVE of the following STEPS: 
STEP ONE: Determine the part of the township's ad valorem property tax levy for calendar year 1989 that was dedicated to the township firefighting fund. STEP TWO: If the township incurred any loans or bonded indebtedness to pay for fire protection or emergency services during the period from January 1, 1987, through December 31, 1989 (excluding loans or bonded indebtedness used to purchase firefighting apparatus or equipment or housing), determine the number of calendar years during that period in which the township incurred the loans or bonded indebtedness. STEP THREE: Calculate the quotient of: 
(A) the total amounts of loans or bonded indebtedness incurred by the township for fire protection and emergency services during the period from January 1, 1987, through December 31, 1989 (excluding loans or bonded indebtedness used to purchase firefighting apparatus or equipment or housing); divided by 
(B) the number determined in STEP TWO. STEP FOUR: Add the result determined in STEP ONE to the result determined in STEP THREE. STEP FIVE: Calculate the maximum ad valorem property tax levy that would result from making the calculations contained in section 3 of this chapter as those calculations apply to the township, using the result obtained in STEP FOUR for the civil taxing unit's maximumpermissible ad valoremproperty tax levy for the preceding calendar year under section 3(a) or 3(b) of this chapter, whichever applies to the township. 
If the amount determined under this subsection is substantially lower than the township's normal expenditure patterns for fire protection and emergency services (excluding the expenditures for the purchase of firefighting apparatus or equipment or housing), the township may appeal to the local government tax control board for an increase in the 1990 maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy for its township firefighting fund. In considering the appeal, the local government tax control board shall consider other sources of revenue used by the township during calendar year 1989 to fund fire protection and emergency services that are also available for such funding in 1990 and thereafter and the board shall also consider any other relevant factors. 
(b) If a township did not have a township firefighting fund under IC 36-8-13-4 for calendar year 1989, but appropriated funds for fire protection or emergency services for that calendar year, the township's maximum ad valorem property tax levy that will apply to the township's firefighting fund under section 3 of this chapter for calendar year 1990 is the amount determined in STEP FIVE of the following STEPS: 
STEP ONE: Determine the amount that the township appropriated from its general fund for fire protection and emergency services (excluding appropriations for the purchase of firefighting apparatus or equipment or housing). STEP TWO: If the township incurred any loans or bonded indebtedness to pay for fire protection or emergency services during the period from January 1, 1987, through December 31, 1989 (excluding loans or bonded indebtedness used to purchase firefighting apparatus or equipment or housing), determine the number of calendar years during that period in which the township incurred the loans or bonded indebtedness. STEP THREE: Calculate the quotient of: 
(A) the total amounts of loans or bonded indebtedness incurred by the township for fire protection and emergency services during the period from January 1, 1987, through December 31, 1989 (excluding loans or bonded indebtedness used to purchase firefighting apparatus or equipment or housing); divided by 
(B) the number determined in STEP TWO. STEP FOUR: Add the result of STEP ONE to the result of STEP THREE. STEP FIVE: Calculate the maximum ad valorem property tax levy that would result from making the calculations contained in section 3 of this chapter, as those calculations apply to the township, using the result obtained in STEP FOUR for the civil taxingunit's maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy for the preceding calendar year under section 3(a) or 3(b) of this chapter, whichever applies to the township. 
If the amount determined under this subsection is substantially lower than the township's normal expenditure patterns for fire protection and emergency services (excluding the expenditures for the purchase of firefighting apparatus or equipment or housing), the township may appeal to the local government tax control board for an increase in its 1990 maximum permissible levy for its township firefighting fund. In considering the appeal, the local government tax control board shall consider other sources of revenue used by the township during calendar year 1989 to fund fire protection and emergency services that are also available for such funding in 1990 and thereafter and the board shall also consider any other relevant factors. 
(c) If for calendar year 1989: 
(1) 
a township had a township firefighting fund under IC 36-8-13-4 but did not have an ad valorem property tax levy for that fund; or 

(2) 
a township did not have a township firefighting fund and appropriated no money for fire protection or emergency services; 


the township's maximum permissible ad valorem property tax levy for its township firefighting fund shall be determined under section 7 of this chapter in the calendar year in which the township first establishes such a levy.

(b) 
If the county fiscal body adopts an ordinance before October 1, 2015, to impose a property tax levy in 2016 and in 2017 under this section, the department shall permit the county to impose the levy in each of those years. The property tax levy: 

(1)

(B) 
the carrier must be a signatory on at least one (1) petition; 

(C) 
after the signatures have been collected, the carrier must swear or affirm before a notary public that the carrier witnessed each signature; and

A person who signs a petition as a registered voter must indicate the address at which the person is registered to vote.

The county voter registration office shall, not more than fifteen (15) business days after receiving a petition, forward a copy of the petition to the county auditor. Not more than ten (10) business days after receiving the copy of the petition, the county auditor shall provide to the county voter registration office a statement verifying: 

(A) 
whether a person who signed the petition as a registered voter but is not a registered voter, as determined by the 

county voter registration office, is the owner of property in the political subdivision; and

(9) 
The county voter registration office shall, not more than ten 

(10) 
business days after receiving the statement from the county auditor under subdivision (8), make the final determination of the number of petitioners that are registered voters in the political subdivision and, based on the statement provided by the county auditor, the number of petitioners that own property within the political subdivision.

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, in determining whether an individual is a registered voter, the county voter registration office shall apply the requirements and procedures used under IC 3 to determine whether a person is a registered voter for purposes of voting in an election governed by IC 3. However, an individual is not required to comply with the provisions concerning providing proof of identification to be considered a registered voter for purposes of this chapter. A person is entitled to sign a petition only one (1) time in a particular petition and remonstrance process under this chapter, regardless of whether the person owns more than one (1) parcel of real property, mobile home assessed as personal property, or manufactured home assessed as personal property, or a combination of those types of property within the subdivision and regardless of whether the person is both a registered voter in the political subdivision and the owner of property within the political subdivision.

The certificate must state the number of petitioners that are owners of property within the political subdivision and the number of petitioners who are registered voters residing within the political subdivision. 
If a sufficient petition requesting a petition and remonstrance process is not filed by owners of property or registered voters as set forth in this section, the political subdivision may issue bonds or enter into a lease by following the provisions of law relating to the bonds to be issued or lease to be entered into. 
(c) This subsection applies only to a political subdivision that, after April 30, 2011, adopts an ordinance or a resolution making a preliminary determination to issue bonds or enter into a lease subject to this section and section 3.2 of this chapter. A political subdivision may not artificially divide a capital project into multiple capital projects in order to avoid the requirements of this section and section 
3.2 of this chapter. A person that owns property within a political subdivision or a person that is a registered voter residing within a political subdivision may file a petition with the department of local government finance objecting that the political subdivision has artificially divided a capital project into multiple capital projects in order to avoid the requirements of this section and section 3.2 of this chapter.

The county voter registration office shall determine whether each person who signed the petition or remonstrance is a registered voter. The county voter registration office shall not more than fifteen (15) business days after receiving a petition or remonstrance forward a copy of the petition or remonstrance to the county auditor. Not more than ten (10) business days after receiving the copy of the petition or remonstrance, the county auditor shall provide to the county voter registration office a statement verifying:

(B) 
the number of registered voters in the political subdivision that signed a remonstrance and, based on the statement provided by the county auditor, the number of owners of property within the political subdivision that signed a remonstrance. 




Whenever the name of an individual who signs a petition or remonstrance as a registered voter contains a minor variation from the name of the registered voter as set forth in the records of the county voter registration office, the signature is presumed to be valid, and there is a presumption that the individual is entitled to sign the petition or remonstrance under this section. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, in determining whether an individual is a registered voter, the county voter registration office shall apply the requirements and procedures used under IC 3 to determine whether a person is a registered voter for purposes of voting in an election governed by IC 3. However, an individual is not required to comply with the provisions concerning providing proof of identification to be considered a registered voter for purposes of this chapter. A person is entitled to sign a petition or remonstrance only one (1) time in a particular petition and remonstrance process under this chapter, regardless of whether the person owns more than one 
(1) 
parcel of real property, mobile home assessed as personal property, or manufactured home assessed as personal property or a combination of those types of property within the subdivision and regardless of whether the person is both a registered voter in the political subdivision and the owner of property within the political subdivision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a petition or remonstrance is presented to the county voter registration office within forty-five (45) days before an election, the county voter registration office may defer acting on the petition or remonstrance, and the time requirements under this section for action by the county voter registration office do not begin to run until five (5) days after the date of the election.

The county 

voter registration office may take an additional five (5) days to review and certify the petition or remonstrance for each additional five thousand (5,000) signatures up to a maximum of sixty (60) days. The certificate must state the number of petitioners and remonstrators that are owners of property within the political subdivision and the number of petitioners who are registered voters residing within the political subdivision. 

(8) 
If a greater number of persons who are either owners of property within the political subdivision or registered voters residing within the political subdivision sign a remonstrance than the number that signed a petition, the bonds petitioned for may not be issued or the lease petitioned for may not be entered into. The proper officers of the political subdivision may not make a preliminary determination to issue bonds or enter into a lease for the controlled project defeated by the petition and remonstrance process under this section or any other controlled project that is not substantially different within one (1) year after the date of the county voter registration office's certificate under subdivision (7). Withdrawal of a petition carries the same consequences as a defeat of the petition. 

(9) 
After a political subdivision has gone through the petition and remonstrance process set forth in this section, the political subdivision is not required to follow any other remonstrance or objection procedures under any other law (including section 5 of this chapter) relating to bonds or leases designed to protect owners of property within the political subdivision from the imposition of property taxes to pay debt service or lease rentals. However, the political subdivision must still receive the approval of the department of local government finance if required by:

(A) 
five hundred (500) persons who are either owners of property within the political subdivision or registered voters residing within the political subdivision; or 

(B) 
five percent (5%) of the registered voters residing within the political subdivision. 



(5) 
The state board of accounts shall design and, upon request by the county voter registration office, deliver to the county voter registration office or the county voter registration office's designated printer the petition forms to be used solely in the petition process described in this section. The county voter registration office shall issue to an owner or owners of property within the political subdivision or a registered voter residing within the political subdivision the number of petition forms requested by the owner or owners or the registered voter. Each form must be accompanied by instructions detailing the requirements that: 

(A) 
the carrier and signers must be owners of property or registered voters; 

(B) 
the carrier must be a signatory on at least one (1) petition; 

(C)

Persons requesting forms may be required to identify themselves as owners of property or registered voters and may be allowed to pick up additional copies to distribute to other owners of property or registered voters. Each person signing a petition must indicate whether the person is signing the petition as a registered voter within the political subdivision or is signing the petition as the owner of property within the political subdivision. A person who signs a petition as a registered voter must indicate the address at which the person is registered to vote. A person who signs a petition as an owner of property must indicate the address of the property owned by the person in the political subdivision. 

(6) 
Each petition must be verified under oath by at least one (1) qualified petitioner in a manner prescribed by the state board of accounts before the petition is filed with the county voter registration office under subdivision (7). 

(7) 
Each petition must be filed with the county voter registration office not more than thirty (30) days after 

publication under subdivision (2) of the notice of the preliminary determination. 

(8) 
The county voter registration office shall determine whether each person who signed the petition is a registered voter. However, after the county voter registration office has determined that at least five hundred twenty-five (525) persons who signed the petition are registered voters within the political subdivision, the county voter registration office is not required to verify whether the remaining persons who signed the petition are registered voters. If the county voter registration office does not determine that at least five hundred twenty-five (525) persons who signed the petition are registered voters, the county voter registration office, not more than fifteen (15) business days after receiving a petition, shall forward a copy of the petition to the county auditor. Not more than ten (10) business days after receiving the copy of the petition, the county auditor shall provide to the county voter registration office a statement verifying: 

(A) 
whether a person who signed the petition as a registered voter but is not a registered voter, as determined by the county voter registration office, is the owner of property in the political subdivision; and

Whenever the name of an individual who signs a petition form as a registered voter contains a minor variation from the name of the registered voter as set forth in the records of the county voter registration office, the signature is presumed to be valid, and there is a presumption that the individual is entitled to sign the petition under this section. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, in determining whether an individual is a registered voter, the county voter registration office shall apply the requirements and procedures used under IC 3 to determine whether a person is a registered voter for purposes of voting in an election governed by IC 3. However, an individual is not required to comply with the provisions concerning providing proof of identification to be considered a registered voter for purposes of this chapter. A person is entitled to sign a petition only one (1) time in a particular referendum process under this chapter, regardless of whether the person owns more than one (1) parcel of real 

property, mobile home assessed as personal property, or manufactured home assessed as personal property or a combination of those types of property within the political subdivision and regardless of whether the person is both a registered voter in the political subdivision and the owner of property within the political subdivision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a petition is presented to the county voter registration office within forty-five (45) days before an election, the county voter registration office may defer acting on the petition, and the time requirements under this section for action by the county voter registration office do not begin to run until five (5) days after the date of the election. 

(10)
 The county voter registration office must file a certificate and each petition with: 

(A) 
the township trustee, if the political subdivision is a township, who shall present the petition or petitions to the township board; or

within thirty-five (35) business days of the filing of the petition requesting the referendum process. The certificate must state the number of petitioners who are owners of property within the political subdivision and the number of petitioners who are registered voters residing within the political subdivision. 
(11) If a sufficient petition requesting the local public question process is not filed by owners of property or registered voters as set forth in this section, the political subdivision may issue bonds or enter into a lease by following the provisions of law relating to the bonds to be issued or lease to be entered into. 
(c) If the proper officers of a political subdivision make a preliminary determination to issue bonds or enter into a lease, the officers shall provide to the county auditor: 
(1) 
a copy of the notice required by subsection (b)(2); and 

(2) 
any other information the county auditor requires to fulfill the county auditor's duties under section 3.6 of this chapter.

section 3.5(a) of this chapter. 
(b) 
If a sufficient petition requesting the application of the local public question process has been filed as set forth in section 3.5 of this chapter, a political subdivision may not impose property taxes to

The public question must appear on the ballot in the form approved by the county election board. If the political subdivision proposing to issue bonds or enter into a lease is located in more than one (1) county, the county election board of each county shall jointly approve the form of the public question that will appear on the ballot in each county. The form approved by the county election board may differ from the language certified to the county election board by the county auditor. If the county election board approves the language of a public question under this subsection, the county election board shall submit the language to the department of local government finance for review. 
(d) 
The department of local government finance shall review the language of the public question to evaluate whether the description of the controlled project is accurate and is not biased against either a vote in favor of the controlled project or a vote against the controlled project. The department of local government finance may either approve the ballot language as submitted or recommend that the ballot language be modified as necessary to ensure that the description of the controlled project is accurate and is not biased. The department of local government finance shall certify its approval or recommendations to the county auditor and the county election board not more than ten (10) days after the language of the public question is submitted to the department for review. If the department of local government finance recommends a modification to the ballot language, the county election board shall, after reviewing the recommendations of the department of local government finance, submit modified ballot language to the department for the department's approval or recommendation of any additional modifications. The public question may not be certified by the county auditor under subsection (e) unless the department of local government finance has first certified the department's final approval of the ballot language for the public question. 

(e) 
The county auditor shall certify the finally approved public question under IC 3-10-9-3 to the county election board of each 


county in which the political subdivision is located. The certification must occur not later than noon:

or municipal election ballot. Subject to the certification requirements and deadlines under this subsection and except as provided in subsection (k), the public question shall be placed on the ballot at the next primary election, general election, or municipal election in which all voters of the political subdivision are entitled to vote. However, if a primary election, general election, or municipal election will not be held during the first year in which the public question is eligible to be placed on the ballot under this section and if the political subdivision requests the public question to be placed on the ballot at a special election, the public question shall be placed on the ballot at a special election to be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in May or November of the year. The certification must occur not later than noon seventy-four (74) days before a special election to be held in May (if the special election is to be held in May) or noon on August 1 (if the special election is to be held in November). The fiscal body of the political subdivision that requests the special election shall pay the costs of holding the special election. The county election board shall give notice under IC 5-3-1 of a special election conducted under this subsection.

(1) 
The political subdivision may not issue the proposed bonds or enter into the proposed lease rental.

(j) 
A political subdivision may not artificially divide a capital project into multiple capital projects in order to avoid the requirements of this section and section 3.5 of this chapter. A person that owns property within a political subdivision or a person that is a registered voter residing within a political subdivision may file a petition with the department of local government finance objecting that the political subdivision has artificially divided a capital project into multiple capital projects in order to avoid the requirements of this section and section 3.5 of this chapter. The petition must be filed not more than ten (10) days after the political subdivision makes the preliminary determination to issue the bonds or enter into the lease for the project.

If the legislative body provides a certified copy of the resolution to the county auditor and the county election board not later than sixty-three (63) days before the election at which the public question would be on the ballot, the public question on the controlled project shall not be placed on the ballot and the public question on the controlled project shall not be held, regardless of whether the county auditor has certified the public question to the county election board. If the withdrawal of a public question under this subsection requires the county election board to reprint ballots, the political subdivision withdrawing the public question shall pay the costs of reprinting the ballots. If a political subdivision withdraws a public question under this subsection that would have been held at a special election and the county election board has printed the ballots before the legislative body of the political subdivision provides a certified copy of the withdrawal resolution to the county auditor and the county election board, the political subdivision withdrawing the public question shall pay the costs incurred by the county in printing the ballots. If a public question on a controlled project is withdrawn under this subsection, a public question under this section on the same controlled project or a substantially similar controlled project may not be submitted to the voters earlier than three hundred fifty (350) days after the date the resolution withdrawing the public question is adopted.

(B) 
Property taxes imposed by a political subdivision to pay for debt service obligations of a political subdivision that are not exempted from the application of a credit granted under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter by section 7(b), 7(c), 7.5(b), or 7.5(c) of this chapter or any other law. Property taxes described in this subsection are subject to the credit granted under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter by section 7(b), 7(c), 7.5(b), or 7.5(c) of this chapter regardless of their designation as protected taxes. 



(3) 
"Unprotected taxes" refers to property taxes that are not protected taxes. 


(c) Except as provided in subsection (e) for property taxes due and payable in 2013, the total amount of revenue to be distributed to the fund for which the protected taxes were imposed shall be determined as if no credit were granted under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter. The total amount of the loss in revenue resulting from the granting of credits under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter must reduce only the amount of unprotected taxes distributed to a fund using the following criteria: 
(1) 
The reduction may be allocated in the amounts determined by the political subdivision using a combination of unprotected taxes of the political subdivision in those taxing districts in which the credit caused a reduction in protected taxes. 

(2) 
The tax revenue and each fund of any other political subdivisions must not be affected by the reduction. 


(d) When: 
(1) 
the revenue that otherwise would be distributed to a fund receiving only unprotected taxes is reduced entirely under subsection (c) and the remaining revenue is insufficient for a fund receiving protected taxes to receive the revenue specified by subsection (c); or 

(2) 
there is not a fund receiving only unprotected taxes from 


which to distribute revenue; the revenue distributed to the fund receiving protected taxes must also be reduced. If the revenue distributed to a fund receiving protected taxes is reduced, the political subdivision may transfer money from one (1) or more of the other funds of the political subdivision to offset the loss in revenue to the fund receiving protected taxes. The transfer is limited to the amount necessary for the fund receiving protected taxes to receive the revenue specified under subsection (c). The amount transferred shall be specifically identified as a debt service obligation transfer for each affected fund. 
(e) This subsection applies to property taxes due and payable in 2013. The total amount of the loss in revenue resulting from the granting of credits under section 7 or 7.5 of this chapter must reduce the amount of protected and unprotected property taxes distributed to a fund in proportion to the property tax levy imposed for that fund relative to the total of all protected and unprotected property tax levies imposed by the political subdivision. The allocations shall be made after the political subdivision receives its distribution. As added by P.L.172-2011, SEC.42. Amended by P.L.137-2012, SEC.35; P.L.257-2013, SEC.29.

the school corporation is not eligible to allocate credits proportionately under this section. 
(b) Subject to subsection (a), a school corporation is eligible to allocate credits proportionately under this section for 2016, 2017, or 2018 if the school corporation's percentage computed under this subsection is at least ten percent (10%) for its transportation fund levy for that year, as certified by the department of local government finance.

(1) 
Compute the amount of credits granted under this chapter against the school corporation's levyfor the school corporation's transportation fund. 

(2) 
Compute the school corporation's levy for the school corporation's transportation fund. 

(3) 
Divide the amount computed under subdivision (1) by the amount computed under subdivision (2) and express it as a percentage. 


The computation must be made by taking into account the requirements of section 9.8 of this chapter regarding protected taxes and the impact of credits granted under this chapter on the revenue to be distributed to the school corporation's transportation fund for the particular year. 
(c) 
A school corporation that desires to be an eligible school corporation under this section must, before May 1 of the year for which it wants a determination, submit a written request for a certification by the department of local government finance that the computation of the school corporation's percentage under subsection 

(b) 
is correct. The department of local government finance shall, not later than June 1 of that year, determine whether the percentage computed by the school corporation is accurate and certify whether the school corporation is eligible under this section. 


(d) For a school corporation that is certified as eligible under this section, the school corporation may allocate the effect of the credits granted under this chapter proportionately among all the school corporation's property tax funds that are not exempt under section 7.5(b) or 7.5(c) of this chapter, based on the levy for each fund and without taking into account the requirements of section 9.8 of this chapter regarding protected taxes.

The only ground of remonstrance or objection that the court may hear is whether the proposed special assessment or tax will help achieve the redevelopment of economic development objectives for the 


allocation area or honor its obligations related to the allocation area. An appeal under this subsection shall be promptly heard by the court without a jury. All remonstrances or objections upon which an appeal has been taken must be consolidated, heard, and determined within thirty (30) days after the time of the filing of the appeal.

the payment of property taxes owed by a taxpayer in a bankruptcy proceeding and payable in November 2001, May 2002, or November 2002; 




exceeds the sum of the taxpayer's property tax liability attributable to the qualified taxing unit for property taxes payable in November 2001, May 2002, and November 2002, the excess as received during any calendar year or years shall be set aside and treated for the calendar year when received as a levy excess subject to IC 6-1.1-18.5-17 or IC 20-44-3. In calculating the payment of property taxes as referred to in subdivision (2), the amount of property tax credit finally allowed under IC 6-1.1-21-5 (before its repeal) in respect to those taxes is considered to be a payment of those property taxes.

This subsection applies only if a statement for payment of property taxes and special assessments by electronic mail is transmitted to a person under section 8.1(h) of this chapter. If a response to the transmission of electronic mail to a person indicates that the electronic mail was not received, the county treasurer shall mail to the person a hard copy of the statement in the manner required by section 8.1(a) of this chapter for persons who do not opt to receive statements by electronic mail.

(1) 
Determine the following: 

(A) 
For a parcel of real property, the most recently determined amount of tax liability that applied to the parcel for the preceding year.

(2) 
the current owner qualifies for an equivalent deduction on property other than the homestead property in the same county or another county in the year of the delayed assessment date;

The county fiscal body shall certify a copy of the resolution to the county auditor, the county treasurer, and the department of local government finance as soon as practicable after the resolution is adopted. The department of local government finance shall conduct a public hearing in the county not more than thirty (30) days after receiving a copy of the certified resolution. The department of local government finance shall give notice of the public hearing one (1) time in accordance with IC 5-3-1. If after the hearing the department of local government finance determines that a delay in the distribution of statements for and payment of current property taxes will result in tax relief to the taxpayers of the county, the department of local government finance shall waive the requirements of IC 6-1.1-22-9 and IC 6-1.1-22.5-6 and any other applicable law, as necessary, and authorize the county to issue a single tax statement for current property taxes and any other special assessments or amounts that would otherwise be billed on the statement before the date specified by the department of local government finance. The specified date may not be before September 16, 2013. Current property taxes and any other special assessments or amounts billed on the statement issued under this subsection are due as provided in a resolution that complies with this section and is adopted by the county fiscal body at any time before the date the single tax statement is mailed or otherwise transmitted. The resolution must establish a payment plan under which taxpayers are required to pay current property taxes and any other special assessments or amounts billed on the single tax statement either by: 

(1) 
paying the current property taxes and any other special assessments or billed amounts in equal payments over an installment period (of at least six (6) months); or 

(2) 
making a single payment of the current property taxes and any other special assessments or billed amounts after the end of a period (of at least six (6) months); 




as determined by the county fiscal body. 
(i) As used in this subsection, "current property taxes" refers to property taxes imposed for the March 1, 2012, or January 15, 2013, assessment date and special assessments due on a tax statement issued for these property taxes in a county that was a covered county in 2009 or 2010. Section 17 of this chapter (right to make payments of property taxes and special assessments by credit card, debit card, bank card, or electronic transfer; transaction charges) and section 25 of this chapter (county council discretionary authority to authorize a two percent (2%) tax credit for payment within thirty (30) days) apply to current property taxes to the same extent as if they were delayed property taxes payable on a reconciliation statement. Notwithstanding any other law, an owner of a homestead (as defined in IC 6-1.1-12-37) may apply for a standard deduction as permitted under IC 6-1.1-12-37 or IC 6-1.1-12-44 from the assessed value of property determined for the March 1, 2012, or January 15, 2013, assessment date at any time on or before a date that is forty-five (45) days after the last reconciliation or other tax statement for the current property taxes is mailed or otherwise transmitted for the current property taxes. An application filed within the time permitted under this subsection shall be treated as a timely application for the standard deduction. A homestead that is eligible for a standard deduction under IC 6-1.1-12-37 for a year in which current property taxes are imposed may not be placed on a list for tax sale for the payment of delinquent current property taxes for at least twelve (12) months after a due date for payment of the current property taxes. Any overpayment of current property taxes that result after the application of a deduction or credit granted after the payment of the current property taxes shall be first applied without the filing of a claim under IC 6-1.1-26. The county treasurer shall apply the excess payment first to any delinquent property taxes owed by the taxpayer who owned the property in the year to which the credit or deduction applies and, second, as a credit against property taxes for the affected property that become first due and payable after the excess payment is determined. Property tax statements issued for current property taxes must include a statement in at least 10-point bold type that explains a taxpayer's rights under subsection (h) and this subsection. 
(j) An action of: 
(1) 
a county assessor, county auditor, or county treasurer that, before May 10, 2013, grants or applies a deduction or credit that is authorized by this section; and 

(2) 
a county fiscal body or the department of local government 


finance taken before May 10, 2013, to carry out this section; is legalized and validated to the same extent as if the action had occurred after May 9, 2013. 
(k) This section shall be liberally construed by the department of local government finance, elected officials, political subdivisions, and the courts to provide taxpayers tax relief described in this section. As added by P.L.11-2013, SEC.1.

When a county treasurer believes that a person who is liable for delinquent personal property taxes is about to take his property from the county without paying the taxes, the treasurer may, in the manner prescribed in this chapter, levy upon and sell sufficient personal property of that person to pay the delinquent taxes, penalties, and collection expenses. The county treasurer is not required to make the demand required by section 1 of this chapter before a levy and sale made under this section. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) 
IC 6-1.1-23-9 Record of delinquencies 
Sec. 9. (a) In the year immediately following the year in which personal property taxes become delinquent, each county treasurer shall prepare a record of the delinquencies for which written demand has been made under section 1 of this chapter and which remain unpaid for at least sixty (60) days after the demand is made. 
(b) 
The county treasurer shall prepare the record required by this section in a form prescribed or approved by the state board of accounts. For each delinquent taxpayer, the record shall contain: 

(1) 
the name of the taxpayer who is personally liable for the taxes as shown by the tax duplicate; 

(2) the last known address of the taxpayer; 

(3) 
the date when the last installment of taxes included in the record became delinquent; and

the amount of all delinquent taxes, penalties, and collection expenses for which such a demand has been made and which remain unpaid. 


(c) The county treasurer shall swear to the accuracy of the record before the clerk of the circuit court and shall file the record with the clerk. When the record is so filed, the amount of delinquent taxes, penalties, and collection expenses stated in the record constitute a debt of the named taxpayer. This debt in all respects has the same force and effect as a judgment. The judgment so entered shall be in favor of the county for the benefit of all taxing units having an interest in it. Beginning the day the record is filed, the delinquent taxpayer shall, instead of the penalties prescribed in IC 1971, 6-1.1-37-10, pay interest on the amount of the judgment at the same rate imposed on other judgments. 
(d) On the date the county treasurer files the record in the office of the clerk of the circuit court, the county treasurer shall make an entry on the tax duplicate in a column headed "Certified to Clerk of Circuit Court." (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.)

Sec. 10. (a) If a judgment entered under section 9 of this chapter is not paid, the county treasurer may notify the delinquent taxpayer by certified mail that a judgment has been entered against him and that the treasurer is going to file a praecipe for execution. If the judgment is not paid within ten (10) days after the date the notice is given, the county treasurer shall file the praecipe for execution. If this notice is not given, an execution upon the judgment is invalid. 
(b) 
If a judgment has been entered against a taxpayer under section 9 of this chapter, the county treasurer may obtain a court order restraining the taxpayer from transacting business in the county. However, the restraining order may be dissolved if the court believes that dissolution of the restraining order will make collection of the judgment more likely. 

(c) 
If a judgment against a taxpayer under section 9 of this chapter has not been satisfied within sixty (60) days after the judgment is entered, the county treasurer may do the following without judicial proceedings: 

(1) 
Levy upon property of the taxpayer that is held by a financial institution. The county treasurer shall make a levy in the same manner as the department of state revenue under IC 6-8.1-8-8. A financial institution that receives a claim under this subdivision shall transfer to the county treasurer property of the taxpayer that is held by the financial institution. However, if the value of the taxpayer's property held by the financial institution is greater than the amount of the judgment, the financial institution shall transfer property of the taxpayer in an amount equal to the amount of the judgment. 

(2) 
Garnish the accrued earnings and wages of the taxpayer by giving notice to the taxpayer's employer. An employer who 




receives a notice under this subdivision shall garnish the accrued earnings and wages of the taxpayer in an amount equal to the full amount subject to garnishment under IC 24-4.5-5-105. The employer: 
(A) 
shall remit the amount garnished under this subdivision to the county treasurer; and 

(B) 
is entitled to a fee equal to the amount of the fee that may be collected under IC 24-4.5-5-105(5) in a garnishment action. However, the taxpayer shall pay the entire fee collected under this clause. 


(3) Withhold the amount of the judgment in full or in part from any payment that: 
(A) 
is due to the taxpayer from the county; and 

(B) 
requires the signature of the county treasurer. 


(d) 
The treasurer of a county may use any combination of remedies provided under this section to collect the following: 

(1) 
Delinquent taxes. 

(2) 
Expenses incurred under IC 6-1.1-23-7(a)(1) through IC 6-1.1-23-7(a)(6). 



(e) 
A county treasurer that incurs attorney's fee expenses for legal services not related to formal judicial proceedings shall petition a circuit or superior court in the county for approval to pay the expenses. The court may conduct a hearing on the petition and may authorize the auditor of the county to issue a warrant for the amount of the reasonable expenses. The county treasurer shall pay the warrant without an appropriation for the disbursement.

Sec. 11. (a) The treasurer of a county in which a judgment is entered under section 9 of this chapter shall send a certificate of the judgment to the treasurer of another county and to the department of local government finance if the county treasurer determines that: 
(1) 
the delinquent taxpayer does not have, in the county in which the judgment is entered, property of sufficient value to satisfy the judgment; and 

(2) 
the delinquent taxpayer does have property in the other county. 


(b) A county treasurer who receives a certificate of judgment shall have the judgment indexed in the judgment docket by the clerk of the circuit court of the county the treasurer serves. The county treasurer shall proceed to have execution issued upon the judgment in the same manner as if the judgment had been originally entered in the county he serves. 
(c) The department of local government finance shall make periodic audits of the records of the county treasurers to insure compliance with the provisions of this section.

the executive of the county, city, or town may, after providing either the notice required by IC 36-7-37 or section 2.3 of this chapter, certify a list of vacant or abandoned property to the county auditor. This list must be delivered to the county auditor not later than fifty-one (51) days after the first tax payment due date each calendar year.

Any amount collected from the sale of all properties under this section above the total minimum bids shall first be used to pay the costs of the county, city, or town that certified the property vacant or abandoned for title search and court proceedings. Any amount remaining from the sale shall be certified by the county treasurer to the county auditor for distribution to other taxing units during settlement.

(h) Except as provided in subsections (i) and (j), if: 
(1) 
the verified petition referred to in subsection (a) is timely filed; and

direct the county auditor to execute and deliver the tax deed; the county auditor shall not execute the deed but shall refund the purchase money minus a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the purchase money from the county treasury to the purchaser, the purchaser's successors or assignees, or the purchaser of the certificate of sale under IC 6-1.1-24. The county auditor shall deposit penalties paid under this subsection in the county general fund. All the delinquent taxes and special assessments shall then be reinstated and recharged to the tax duplicate and collected in the same manner as if the property had not been offered for sale. The tract or item of real property, if it is then eligible for sale under IC 6-1.1-24, shall be placed on the delinquent list as an initial offering under IC 6-1.1-24. 
(j) 
Notwithstanding subsections (h) and (i), the court shall not order the return of the purchase price or any part of the purchase price if:

(2)

(k) 
A tax deed executed under this section vests in the grantee an estate in fee simple absolute, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances created or suffered before or after the tax sale except those liens granted priority under federal law, and the lien of the state or a political subdivision for taxes and special assessments that accrue subsequent to the sale. However, the estate is subject to all easements, covenants, declarations, and other deed restrictions and laws governing land use, including all zoning restrictions and liens and encumbrances created or suffered by the purchaser at the tax sale.

(2) 
the regularity of all proper proceedings; and 

(3) 
valid title in fee simple in the grantee of the deed.

(1) 
the county assessor has not transmitted to the department of local government finance by October 1 of the year in which the distribution is scheduled to be made the data for all townships in the county required to be transmitted under IC 6-1.1-4-25; 

(2) 
the county auditor has not paid a bill for services under IC 6-1.1-4-31.5 to the department of local government finance in a timely manner; 

(3) 
the county assessor has not forwarded to the department of local government finance in a timely manner sales disclosure form data under IC 6-1.1-5.5-3;

the county auditor has not forwarded to the department of local government finance the duplicate copies of all approved exemption applications required to be forwarded by that date under IC 6-1.1-11-8(a); 

(5) 
by the date the distribution is scheduled to be made, the county auditor has not sent a certified statement required to be sent by that date under IC 6-1.1-17-1 to the department of local government finance;

(8) 
the county has not established a parcel index numbering system under 50 IAC 23-8-1 in a timely manner; 

(9) 
a county official has not provided other information to the department of local government finance in a timely manner as required by the department of local government finance; or 

(10) 
the department of local government finance incurs additional costs to assist a covered county (as defined in IC 6-1.1-22.6-1) to issue tax statements within the time frame specified in IC 6-1.1-22.6-18(b) for each year that the county experienced delayed property taxes (as defined in IC 6-1.1-22.6-2) before the year in which the county qualifies as a covered county. 


The percentage to be withheld is the percentage determined by the department of local government finance.

(1) provide information; or 
(2) 
pay a bill for services; has been corrected.

(1) provide information; or 

(2) 
pay a bill for services; in a timely manner is justified by unusual circumstances. 

(d) 
The department of local government finance shall give the county auditor at least thirty (30) days notice in writing before the department of state revenue or the auditor of state withholds a distribution under subsection (a). 

(e) 
Money not distributed for the reason stated in subsection (a)(2) may be deposited in the fund established by IC 6-1.1-5.5-4.7(a). Money deposited under this subsection is not subject to distribution under subsection (b). 


(f) This subsection applies to a county that will not receive a distribution under IC 6-3.5-1.1, IC 6-3.5-6, or IC 6-3.5-7.

(1) 
All contract fees and other costs related to the contract. 

(2) 
After the payments required by subdivision (1) have been made and the contract has expired, the county auditor shall distribute all money remaining in the fund to the appropriate taxing units in the county using the property tax rates of each taxing unit in effect at the time of the distribution.

Sec. 11. (a) If a taxpayer is entitled to a property tax refund or credit because an assessment is decreased, the taxpayer shall also be paid, or credited with, interest on the excess taxes that the taxpayer paid at the rate established for excess tax payments by the commissioner of the department of state revenue under IC 6-8.1-10-1. However, in the case of an assessment that is decreased by the Indiana board or the Indiana tax court, the taxpayer is not entitled to the greater of five hundred dollars ($500) or twenty percent (20%) of the interest to which the taxpayer would otherwise be entitled on the excess taxes unless the taxpayer affirms, under penalty of perjury, that substantive evidence supporting the taxpayer's position had been: 
(1) presented by the taxpayer to the assessor before; or 
(2) 
introduced by the taxpayer at; the hearing held by the county property tax assessment board of appeals. An appraisal may not be required by the county property tax assessment board of appeals or the assessor in a proceeding before the county property tax assessment board of appeals or in a preliminary informal meeting under IC 6-1.1-15-1(h)(2). 

(b) 
For purposes of this section and except as provided in subsection (c), the interest shall be computed: 

(1) 
from the date on which the taxes were paid or due, whichever is later, to the date of the refund or credit; and 

(2) 
using the rate in effect under IC 6-8.1-10-1 for each 




particular year covered by the refund or credit. If a taxpayer is sent a provisional tax statement and is later sent a final or reconciling tax statement, interest shall be computed after the date on which the taxes were paid or first due under the provisional tax statement, whichever is later, through the date of the refund or credit. 
(c) 
This subsection applies if a taxpayer who is entitled to a refund or credit does not make a written request for the refund or credit to the county auditor within forty-five (45) days after the final determination of the county property tax assessment board of appeals, the state board of tax commissioners, the department of local government finance, the Indiana board, or the tax court that entitles the taxpayer to the refund or credit. In the case of a taxpayer described in this subsection, the interest shall be computed from the date on which the taxes were paid or due to the date that is forty-five 

(45) 
days after the final determination of the county property tax assessment board of appeals, the state board of tax commissioners, the department of local government finance, the Indiana board of tax review, or the Indiana tax court. In any event, a property tax refund or credit must be issued not later than ninety (90) days after the request is received.

Except as otherwise provided in this section, part or all of the property tax proceeds in excess of those described in subdivision (1), as specified in the declaratory ordinance, shall be allocated to the unit for the economic development district and, when collected, paid into a special fund established by the unit for that economic development district that may be used only to pay the principal of and interest on obligations owed by the unit under IC 4-4-8 (before its repeal) or IC 5-28-9 for the financing of industrial development programs in, or serving, that economic development district. The amount not paid into the special fund shall be paid to the respective units in the manner prescribed by subdivision (1). 

(3)

(b) Property tax proceeds allocable to the economic development district under subsection (a)(2) must, subject to subsection (a)(3), be irrevocably pledged by the unit for payment as set forth in subsection (a)(2). 
(c) For the purpose of allocating taxes levied by or for any taxing unit or units, the assessed value of taxable property in a territory in the economic development district that is annexed by any taxing unit after the effective date of the allocation provision of the declaratory ordinance is the lesser of: 
(1) 
the assessed value of the property for the assessment date with respect to which the allocation and distribution is made; or 

(2) 
the base assessed value. 


(d) 
Notwithstanding any other law, each assessor shall, upon petition of the fiscal body, reassess the taxable property situated upon or in, or added to, the economic development district effective on the next assessment date after the petition. 

(e) 
Notwithstanding any other law, the assessed value of all taxable property in the economic development district, for purposes of tax limitation, property tax replacement, and formulation of the budget, tax rate, and tax levy for each political subdivision in which the property is located, is the lesser of: 

(1) 
the assessed value of the property as valued without regard to this section; or 

(2) 
the base assessed value. 



(f) 
The state board of accounts and department of local government finance shall make the rules and prescribe the forms and procedures that they consider expedient for the implementation of this chapter. After each:

(2) 
reassessment of a group of parcels under a reassessment 




plan prepared under IC 6-1.1-4-4.2; the department of local government finance shall adjust the base assessed value one (1) time to neutralize any effect of the reassessment on the property tax proceeds allocated to the district under this section. After each annual adjustment under IC 6-1.1-4-4.5, the department of local government finance shall adjust the base assessed value to neutralize any effect of the annual adjustment on the property tax proceeds allocated to the district under this section. However, the adjustments under this subsection may not include the effect of property tax abatements under IC 6-1.1-12.1. 
(g) As used in this section, "property taxes" means: 
(1) 
taxes imposed under this article on real property; and 

(2) 
any part of the taxes imposed under this article on depreciable personal property that the unit has by ordinance allocated to the economic development district. However, the ordinance may not limit the allocation to taxes on depreciable personal property with any particular useful life or lives. 


If a unit had, by ordinance adopted before May 8, 1987, allocated to an economic development district property taxes imposed under IC 6-1.1 on depreciable personal property that has a useful life in excess of eight (8) years, the ordinance continues in effect until an ordinance is adopted by the unit under subdivision (2). 
(h) As used in this section, "base assessed value" means: 
(1) 
the net assessed value of all the property as finally determined for the assessment date immediately preceding the effective date of the allocation provision of the declaratory resolution, as adjusted under subsection (f); plus 

(2) 
to the extent that it is not included in subdivision (1), the net assessed value of property that is assessed as residential property under the rules of the department of local government finance, as finally determined for any assessment date after the effective date of the allocation provision. 


Subdivision (2) applies only to economic development districts established after June 30, 1997, and to additional areas established after June 30, 1997.

Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), and subject to subsection (d) and section 14 of this chapter, for the first five (5) years, the amount of the deduction for new manufacturing equipment that an owner is entitled to for a particular year equals the assessed value of the new manufacturing equipment. 
Subject to subsection (d) and section 14 of this chapter, for the sixth through the tenth year, the amount of the deduction equals the product of: 
(1) 
the assessed value of the new manufacturing equipment; multiplied by 

(2)

10th  50%  
11th and thereafter  0%  

(b) 
A deduction under this section is not allowed in the first year the deduction is claimed for new manufacturing equipment to the extent that it would cause the assessed value of all of the personal property of the owner in the taxing district in which the equipment is located to be less than the assessed value of all of the personal property of the owner in that taxing district in the immediately preceding year. 

(c) 
If a deduction is not fully allowed under subsection (b) in the first year the deduction is claimed, then the percentages specified in subsection (a) apply in the subsequent years to the amount of deduction that was allowed in the first year. 

(d) 
For purposes of subsection (a), the assessed value of new manufacturing equipment that is part of an owner's assessable depreciable personal property in a single taxing district subject to the valuation limitation in 50 IAC 4.2-4-9 or 50 IAC 5.1-6-9 is the product of: 

(1) 
the assessed value of the equipment determined without regard to the valuation limitation in 50 IAC 4.2-4-9 or 50 IAC 5.1-6-9; multiplied by 

(2) 
the quotient of: 

(A) 
the amount of the valuation limitation determined under 50 IAC 4.2-4-9 or 50 IAC 5.1-6-9 for all of the owner's depreciable personal property in the taxing district; divided by 

(B) 
the total true tax value of all of the owner's depreciable personal property in the taxing district that is subject to the valuation limitation in 50 IAC 4.2-4-9 or 50 IAC 5.1-6-9 determined:

Upon notification of approval of the application or of alteration of the amount of the deduction, the county auditor shall make the deduction. 

(e) 
If the ownership of new manufacturing equipment changes, the deduction provided under section 10 of this chapter continues to apply to that equipment if the new owner: 

(1) 
continues to use the equipment in compliance with any standards established under section 7(c) of this chapter; and 

(2)
