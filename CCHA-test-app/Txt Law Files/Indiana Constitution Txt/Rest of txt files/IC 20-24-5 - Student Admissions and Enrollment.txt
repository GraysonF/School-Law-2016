ensure that a student who attends the charter school during a school year may continue to attend the charter school in subsequent years; 

(2) 
ensure that a student who attends a charter school during a school year may continue to attend a different charter school held by the same organizer in subsequent years; 

(3) 
allow the siblings of a student who attends a charter school or a charter school held by the same organizer to attend the same charter school the student is attending; and 

(4) 
allow preschool students who attend a Level 3 or Level 4 Paths to QUALITY program (as defined in IC 12-17.2-3.8-1) preschool to attend kindergarten at a charter school if the charter school and the preschool provider have entered into an agreement to share services or facilities.

(2) 
siblings of students described in subdivision (1). 



(e) 
A charter school may give enrollment preference to children of the charter school's founders, governing body members, and charter school employees, as long as the enrollment preference under this subsection is not given to more than ten percent (10%) of the charter school's total population.
