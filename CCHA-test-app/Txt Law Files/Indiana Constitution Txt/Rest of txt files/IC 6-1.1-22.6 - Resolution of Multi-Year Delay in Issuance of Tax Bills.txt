(1) 
the current owner did not reside at or own the homestead property in the year of the delayed assessment date; 

(2) 
the current owner qualifies for an equivalent deduction on property other than the homestead property in the same county or another county in the year of the delayed assessment date; 

(3) 
the homestead property was not used for purposes that would have qualified for the deduction in the year of the delayed assessment date; or

(e)

(f) 
Except as provided by rule adopted by the department of local government finance under IC 4-22-2 or an emergency rule adopted in the manner provided under IC 4-22-2-37.1, the county auditor and county treasurer shall apply the deductions and credits granted by this section to homestead property without requiring the current owner to apply for a deduction for that delayed assessment date. The county treasurer may apply the deductions and credits on a provisional statement or a reconciliation statement. If the county treasurer sends out a reconciliation statement for the delayed property taxes due for a delayed assessment date that does not reflect the deductions and credits, the county treasurer shall send out a revised reconciliation statement that reflects the deductions and credits with instructions on how to seek a refund if the property taxes for the delayed assessment date have been paid.

Rules adopted under this subsection must be designed to minimize the administrative burden on current owners that are eligible for deductions and credits granted under this section and other taxpayers eligible for a delayed payment date under subsection (h) or tax relief under subsection (i). 

(h) 
This subsection applies to current property taxes. As used in this subsection, "current property taxes" refers to property taxes imposed for the March 1, 2012, or January 15, 2013, assessment date in a county that is or has been a covered county. The county fiscal body may adopt a resolution before July 1, 2013, to request that the department of local government finance waive the requirements of IC 6-1.1-22-9 and IC 6-1.1-22.5-6 and any other applicable law for current property taxes. The county fiscal body shall certify a copy of the resolution to the county auditor, the county treasurer, and the department of local government finance as soon as practicable after the resolution is adopted. The department of local government finance shall conduct a public hearing in the county not more than thirty (30) days after receiving a copy of the certified resolution. The department of local government finance shall give notice of the public hearing one (1) time in accordance with IC 5-3-1. If after the hearing the department of local government finance determines that a delay in the distribution of statements for and payment of current property taxes will result in tax relief to the taxpayers of the county, the department of local government finance shall waive the requirements of IC 6-1.1-22-9 and IC 6-1.1-22.5-6 and any other applicable law, as necessary, and authorize the county to issue a single tax statement for current property taxes and any other special assessments or amounts that would otherwise be billed on the statement before the date specified by the department of local government finance. The specified date may not be before September 16, 2013. Current property taxes and any other special assessments or amounts billed on the statement issued under this subsection are due as provided in a resolution that complies with this section and is adopted by the county fiscal body at any time before the date the single tax statement is mailed or otherwise transmitted. The resolution must establish a payment plan under which taxpayers are required to pay current property taxes and any other special assessments or amounts billed on the single tax statement either by: 

(1) 
paying the current property taxes and any other special assessments or billed amounts in equal payments over an installment period (of at least six (6) months); or 

(2) 
making a single payment of the current property taxes and any other special assessments or billed amounts after the end of a period (of at least six (6) months); 




as determined by the county fiscal body. 
(i) As used in this subsection, "current property taxes" refers to property taxes imposed for the March 1, 2012, or January 15, 2013, assessment date and special assessments due on a tax statement issued for these property taxes in a county that was a covered county in 2009 or 2010. Section 17 of this chapter (right to make payments of property taxes and special assessments by credit card, debit card, bank card, or electronic transfer; transaction charges) and section 25 of this chapter (county council discretionary authority to authorize a two percent (2%) tax credit for payment within thirty (30) days) apply to current property taxes to the same extent as if they were delayed property taxes payable on a reconciliation statement. Notwithstanding any other law, an owner of a homestead (as defined in IC 6-1.1-12-37) may apply for a standard deduction as permitted under IC 6-1.1-12-37 or IC 6-1.1-12-44 from the assessed value of property determined for the March 1, 2012, or January 15, 2013, assessment date at any time on or before a date that is forty-five (45) days after the last reconciliation or other tax statement for the current property taxes is mailed or otherwise transmitted for the current property taxes. An application filed within the time permitted under this subsection shall be treated as a timely application for the standard deduction. A homestead that is eligible for a standard deduction under IC 6-1.1-12-37 for a year in which current property taxes are imposed may not be placed on a list for tax sale for the payment of delinquent current property taxes for at least twelve (12) months after a due date for payment of the current property taxes. Any overpayment of current property taxes that result after the application of a deduction or credit granted after the payment of the current property taxes shall be first applied without the filing of a claim under IC 6-1.1-26. The county treasurer shall apply the excess payment first to any delinquent property taxes owed by the taxpayer who owned the property in the year to which the credit or deduction applies and, second, as a credit against property taxes for the affected property that become first due and payable after the excess payment is determined. Property tax statements issued for current property taxes must include a statement in at least 10-point bold type that explains a taxpayer's rights under subsection (h) and this subsection. 
(j) An action of: 
(1) 
a county assessor, county auditor, or county treasurer that, before May 10, 2013, grants or applies a deduction or credit that is authorized by this section; and 

(2) 
a county fiscal body or the department of local government 


finance taken before May 10, 2013, to carry out this section; is legalized and validated to the same extent as if the action had occurred after May 9, 2013. 
(k) This section shall be liberally construed by the department of local government finance, elected officials, political subdivisions, and the courts to provide taxpayers tax relief described in this section. As added by P.L.11-2013, SEC.1.
