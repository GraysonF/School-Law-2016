Sec. 1. As used in this chapter, "prior law" refers to the statutes concerning education that are repealed or amended in the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly as the statutes existed before the effective date of the applicable or corresponding provision of the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly. As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.1. 

IC 20-17-1-2 Purpose of recodification 
Sec. 2. The purpose of the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly is to recodify prior law in a style that is clear, concise, and easy to interpret and apply. Except to the extent that: 
(1) 
the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly is amended to reflect the changes made in a provision of another bill that adds to, amends, or repeals a provision in the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly; or 

(2) 
the minutes of meetings of the code revision commission 


during 2004 expressly indicate a different purpose; the substantive operation and effect of the prior law continue uninterrupted as if the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly had not been enacted. As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.1.

certificates of registration; 

(D) 
grants of authority; or 

(E) 
limitations of authority; or 



(11) 
the validity of court decisions entered regarding the 


constitutionality of any provision of the prior law; before the effective date of the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly (July 1, 2005). Those rights, liabilities, penalties, violations, proceedings, bonds, notes, loans, other forms of indebtedness, tax levies, funds, patents, contracts, easements, leases, permits, licenses, certificates of registration, grants of authority, and limitations of authority continue and shall be imposed and enforced under prior law as if the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly had not been enacted. 
(b) The recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly does not: 
(1) 
extend or cause to expire a permit, license, certificate of registration, or other grant or limitation of authority; or 

(2) 
in any way affect the validity, scope, or status of a license, permit, certificate of registration, or other grant or limitation of authority; 


issued under the prior law. 
(c) The recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly does not affect the revocation, limitation, or suspension of a permit, license, certificate of registration, or other grant or limitation of authority based in whole or in part on violations of the prior law or the rules adopted under the prior law.

IC 20-17-1-5 Recodification of prior law 
Sec. 5. The recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly shall be construed as a recodification of prior law. Except as provided in section 2(1) and 2(2) of this chapter, if the literal meaning of the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly (including a literal application of an erroneous change to an internal reference) would result in a substantive change in the prior law, the difference shall be construed as a typographical, spelling, or other clerical error that must be corrected by: 
(1) inserting, deleting, or substituting words, punctuation, or other matters of style in the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly; or 
(2) using any other rule of statutory construction; as necessary or appropriate to apply the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly in a manner that does not result in a substantive change in the law. The principle of statutory construction that a court must apply the literal meaning of an act if the literal meaning of the act is unambiguous does not apply to the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly to the extent that the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly is not substantively identical to the prior law.

As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.1. 

IC 20-17-1-8 References to prior rules

(1) 
any rights or liabilities accrued; 

(2)

the validity of court decisions entered regarding the 


constitutionality of any provision of the prior law; before the effective date of the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly (July 1, 2005). Those rights, liabilities, penalties, violations, proceedings, bonds, notes, loans, other forms of indebtedness, tax levies, funds, patents, contracts, easements, leases, permits, licenses, certificates of registration, grants of authority, and limitations of authority continue and shall be imposed and enforced under prior law as if the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly had not been enacted. 
(c) The inclusion or omission in the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly of a citation to a provision in the prior law does not affect the use of a prior conviction, violation, or noncompliance under the prior law as the basis for revocation of a license, permit, certificate of registration, or other grant of authority under the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly, as necessary or appropriate to apply the recodification act of the 2005 regular session of the general assembly in a manner that does not result in a substantive change in the law.
