IC 20-23-5-10 Remonstrances; form; filing; contents 
Sec. 10. (a) A remonstrance under section 8 of this chapter must be in the following or a substantially similar form: 
"The undersigned hereby remonstrate against the annexation of 
the following described territory situated in ______ County, 
Indiana, whereby it would be transferred from ______ (the 
losing corporation) to _______ (the acquiring corporation): 
(Description of the annexed territory sufficient to identify it.)". The remonstrance may be filed in any number of counterparts. Each counterpart shall have attached to it the affidavit of the person circulating it that each signature appearing on the remonstrance was affixed in the presence of the person circulating the petition and is the true and lawful signature of the person who made the signature. The person who makes the affidavit does not have to be one (1) of the persons who signs the counterpart to which the affidavit is attached. The remonstrance must be accompanied by a complaint filed by one (1) or more of the remonstrators (who shall be treated as a representative of the entire class of remonstrators) and signed by the remonstrator or the remonstrator's attorney, stating the reasons for the remonstrance. The reasons for the remonstrance are limited to the following: 
(1) 
There is a procedural defect in the manner in which the annexation is carried out that is jurisdictional. 

(2) 
The annexed territory does not form a compact area abutting the acquiring corporation. 

(3) 
The benefits to be derived from the annexation are outweighed by the detriments, taking into consideration the respective benefits and detriments to the schools and of the students residing in the acquiring school corporation, the losing school corporation, and the annexed territory. 

(4) 
The: 

(A) 
disposition of assets and liabilities of the losing school corporation; 

(B) 
allocation of school tax receipts between the acquiring school corporation and the losing school corporation; and 

(C) 
amount to be paid by the acquiring school corporation as 




set out in the annexation resolution; are inequitable. Except with respect to subdivision (1), the allegations may be made in the statutory language. 
(b) 
The plaintiff in a remonstrance under section 8 of this chapter must be the person whose name appears on the complaint. The defendants in a remonstrance under section 8 of this chapter shall be both the acquiring school corporation and the losing school corporation. Service of process shall be made on the defendants as in other civil actions. 

(c) 
To determine if a petition was timely filed, the time of filing is the time of filing with the clerk without regard to the time of issuance of the summons. If the thirtieth day falls on Sunday, a holiday, or any other day when the clerk's office is not open, the time shall be extended to the next day when the office is open. 

(d) 
The issues in a remonstrance under section 8 of this chapter are made up by the complaint. The allegations in the complaint shall be treated as denied by each defendant. A responsive pleading may not be filed except that any defendant may, if appropriate, file a motion to dismiss the remonstrance on the ground that: 

(1) 
the requisite number of qualified remonstrators have not signed the petition; 

(2) 
the remonstrance was not timely filed; or 



(3) 
the complaint does not state a cause of action. A responsive pleading to this motion may not be filed. With respect to a motion under subdivisions (1) and (2), the allegations of the pleading shall be treated as denied by the remonstrators. To determine whether there are the requisite number of qualified remonstrators, a person may not withdraw the person's name after a remonstrance has been filed or add the person's name to the remonstrance. Any person may, however, at the trial of the cause and in support or derogation of the substantive matters in the complaint, introduce into evidence a verified statement that the person wishes the person's name added to or withdrawn from the remonstrance. The court may either hear all or a part of the matters raised by the motion to dismiss separately or may consolidate for trial all or a part of the matters with the matters relating to the substance of the case. A complaint may not be dismissed for failure to state a cause of action if a fair reading of the complaint supports one (1) of the grounds for remonstrance provided in subsection (a). The court may permit an amendment of the complaint if the amendment does not state a new ground of remonstrance. 

(e) 
The trial of a remonstrance shall be conducted as other civil cases by the court without the intervention of a jury on the issues raised by the complaint or a motion to dismiss, or both. A change of venue from a judge may be permitted. A change of venue from the county may not be permitted. The court shall expedite the hearing of the case. The court's judgment, except with respect to any matter 


raised under subsection (a)(4), shall be either that: 
(1) 
the annexation shall take place; 

(2) 
the annexation shall not take place; or 


(3) the remonstrance shall be dismissed. If the court finds that the remonstrators have proved any of the reasons for the remonstrance described in subsection (a)(1) through (a)(4), the court's judgment shall be that the annexation may not take place. Unless the remonstrators have proved at least one (1) of the reasons for a remonstrance described in subsection (a)(1) through (a)(4), the court's judgment shall be that the annexation shall take place. With respect to any matter raised under subsection (a)(4), the court's judgment may be either that the disposition, allocation, and amount set out in the annexing resolution is equitable or that it is inequitable. In the latter event, the court in the court's judgment shall provide for an equitable disposition, allocation, and amount. Costs shall follow judgment. Appeals may be taken from any judgment of the court in the same manner as appeals are taken in other civil cases. As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.7. 

IC 20-23-5-11 Adoption of plans for governing bodies of school corporations 
Sec. 11. (a) Within sixty (60) days after the annexation takes place, the governing body of the acquiring school corporation and losing school corporation shall adopt a plan determining the manner in which the governing body shall be constituted. The plan shall be adopted in accordance with the requirements and procedures of IC 20-23-8, except as set out in subsection (b). 
(b) The adoption of a plan by the governing body in accordance with IC 20-23-8-10 and its submission to the state board under IC 20-23-8-15 are the only procedures required when an existing plan is changed as follows: 
(1) 
All governing body members are elected at large, and there are no governing body member residency districts. 

(2) 
Governing body members are elected from governing body member residency districts, and the annexed territory is added to or deleted from one (1) or more districts. 

(3) 
A governing body member is appointed from a given area or district, and the annexed territory is added to or deleted from one (1) or more districts or areas. 

(4) 
A governing body member is elected solely by the voters in a school governing body member district, but the addition or deletion of the annexed territory to or from an existing district does not constitute a denial of equal protection of the laws. 


If a school corporation elects or appoints members of its governing body both from a school governing body member district encompassing the entire school corporation and from smaller districts, the governing body of the acquiring school corporation shall add the annexed territory both to the district consisting of the entire school corporation and to one (1) or more smaller districts. In a comparable situation, the losing school corporation shall delete the annexed territory both from the district consisting of the entire school corporation and from any smaller district or districts. The change in the plan becomes effective upon its approval by the state board. The application of this subsection does not limit the initiation of, or further changes in, any plan under IC 20-23-8. 
As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.7. 
IC 20-23-5-12 Disposition of assets and liabilities of losing school corporation; allocation of school tax receipts and amount to be paid by acquiring school corporation; standards 
Sec. 12. (a) With respect to whether the disposition of the assets and liabilities of the losing school corporation, allocation of school tax receipts, and the amount to be paid by the acquiring school corporation is equitable, the court, subject to subsection (b), shall be satisfied that the annexing resolution conforms substantially to the following standards: 
(1) 
The acquiring school corporation shall assume a part of all installments of principal and interest on any indebtedness of the losing school corporation (other than current obligations or temporary borrowing) that fall due after the end of the last calendar year in which the losing school corporation is entitled to receive current tax receipts from property tax levies on the property of the annexed territory. The part consists of the following: 

(A) 
All installments relating to any indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition or construction of any building located in the annexed territory. 

(B) 
A proportion of all installments relating to any other indebtedness that is the same proportion as the valuation of the real property in the annexed territory bears to the valuation of all the real property in the losing school corporation, as the indebtedness is assessed for general taxation immediately before annexation. 



(2) 
The acquiring school corporation shall make the payments and assume the obligations provided for a school corporation acquiring territory or a building or buildings under IC 20-47-5. 


(b) Standards under subsection (a) may not be applicable to the extent the losing school corporation and acquiring school corporation otherwise agree in a situation where all or a majority of the students in the annexed territory have been transferred from the losing school corporation to the acquiring school corporation for the five (5) school years immediately preceding the transfer. The agreement between school corporations may not prejudice the rights of bondholders or lessors whose rights against the losing school corporation and acquiring school corporation shall, upon enforcement, be allocated between the losing school corporation and acquiring school corporation in accordance with subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2).

IC 20-23-5-13 Effectivedate of annexationincaseofremonstrance; limitations on new annexation proceeding following adverse judgment 
Sec. 13. (a) If a remonstrance is filed on grounds other than the grounds in section 10(a)(4) of this chapter, annexation does not become effective until final judgment in the remonstrance suit. Judgment may not be considered to be final until: 
(1) the time for taking an appeal has expired; or 
(2) final judgment in the appeal is entered. A judgment of the trial court dismissing a remonstrance is a final judgment. If judgment is against the annexation, a further annexation of the annexed territory may not take place for two (2) years after the date the remonstrance was filed. A final judgment may not prevent either the acquiring school corporation or acquiring school corporation and losing school corporation from rescinding the annexation resolution. If the suit is dismissed without prejudice, the two (2) year prohibition does not apply unless a subsequent annexation resolution is adopted primarily for the purpose of harassment and not for some other purpose, including the correction of procedural irregularities or a substantial change in the annexed territory or the annexation resolution. 
(b) If the remonstrance relates solely to any matter raised under section 10(a)(4) of this chapter, the annexation takes effect at the time provided under section 8 of this chapter. As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.7. 

IC 20-23-5-14 Repeal of conflicting laws; supplemental effect of chapter 
Sec. 14. (a) Laws or parts of laws in conflict with this chapter are repealed. This chapter may not be construed to repeal any part of IC 20-23-4 or any statute concerning the consolidation of two (2) or more school corporations, to which this chapter is supplementary, except to the extent that IC 20-23-4 conflicts with this section. 
(b) An annexation that is undertaken under or that results by operation of any section of this chapter may require, for its effectiveness, any approval of any county committee or state commission or committee created under, or referred to in, IC 20-23-4. As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.7.
