§ 621. Congressional statement of findings and
purpose
(a) The Congress hereby finds and declares
that—
(1) in the face of rising productivity and affluence, older workers find themselves disadvantaged in their efforts to retain employment, and especially to regain employment
when displaced from jobs;
(2) the setting of arbitrary age limits regardless of potential for job performance has become a common practice, and certain otherwise desirable practices may work to the disadvantage of older persons;
(3) the incidence of unemployment, especially long-term unemployment with resultant
deterioration of skill, morale, and employer
acceptability is, relative to the younger ages,
high among older workers; their numbers are
great and growing; and their employment
problems grave;
(4) the existence in industries affecting commerce, of arbitrary discrimination in employment because of age, burdens commerce and
the free flow of goods in commerce.
(b) It is therefore the purpose of this chapter
to promote employment of older persons based
on their ability rather than age; to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination in employment; to
help employers and workers find ways of meeting problems arising from the impact of age on
employment.
