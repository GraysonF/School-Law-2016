STEP ONE: The office shall identify the aggregate inpatient hospital services, reimbursable under this article and under the state Medicaid plan, that were provided during the state fiscal year by hospitals established and operated under IC 16-22-2, IC 16-22-8, or IC 16-23. STEP TWO: For the aggregate inpatient hospital services identified under STEP ONE, the office shall calculate the aggregate payments made under this article and under the state Medicaid plan to hospitals established and operated under IC 16-22-2, IC 16-22-8, or IC 16-23, excluding payments under IC 12-15-16, IC 12-15-17, and IC 12-15-19. STEP THREE: The office shall calculate a reasonable estimate of the amount that would have been paid in the aggregate by the office for the inpatient hospital services described in STEP ONE under Medicare payment principles.

STEP FIVE: Subject to subsection (g), from the amount calculated under STEP FOUR, allocate to a hospital established and operated under IC 16-22-8 an amount not to exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the difference between: 
(A) 
the total cost for the hospital's provision of inpatient services covered under this article for the hospital's fiscal 

year ending during the state fiscal year; and

(c) Subject to subsection (e), reimbursement for a state fiscal year under this section consists of payments made after the close of each state fiscal year. A hospital is not eligible for a payment described in this subsection unless an intergovernmental transfer or certification of expenditures is made under subsection (d). 
(d) Subject to subsection (e): 
(1) 
an intergovernmental transfer may be made by or on behalf of the hospital; or 

(2) 
a certification of expenditures as eligible for federal

The periods described in subsections (c) and (d) for the hospital or another entity to make an intergovernmental transfer or certification of expenditures are tolled pending the administrative appeal and any judicial review initiated by the hospital under IC 4-21.5. The distribution to other hospitals under subsection (b) may not be delayed due to an administrative appeal or judicial review instituted by a hospital under this subsection. If necessary, the office may make a partial distribution to the other eligible hospitals under subsection 

(b) 
pending the completion of a hospital's administrative appeal or judicial review, at which time the remaining portion of the payments due to the eligible hospitals shall be made. A partial distribution may be based upon estimates and trends calculated by the office. 


(f) For purposes of this section: 
(1) the Medicaid shortfall of a hospital established and operated 
under IC 16-22-2 or IC 16-23 is calculated as follows: STEP ONE: The office shall identify the inpatient hospital services, reimbursable under this article and under the state Medicaid plan, that were provided during the state fiscal year by the hospital. STEP TWO: For the inpatient hospital services identified under STEP ONE, the office shall calculate the payments made under this article and under the state Medicaid plan to the hospital, excluding payments under IC 12-15-16, IC 12-15-17, and IC 12-15-19. STEP THREE: The office shall calculate a reasonable estimate of the amount that would have been paid by the office for the inpatient hospital services described in STEP ONE under Medicare payment principles; and 
(2) 
a hospital's Medicaid shortfall is equal to the amount by which the amount calculated in STEP THREE of subdivision 

(1) 
is greater than the amount calculated in STEP TWO of subdivision (1). 


(g) The actual distribution of the amount calculated under STEP FIVE of subsection (b) to a hospital established and operated under IC 16-22-8 shall be made under the terms and conditions provided for the hospital in the state plan for medical assistance. Payment to a hospital under STEP FIVE of subsection (b) is not a condition precedent to the tender of payments to hospitals under STEP SEVEN of subsection (b).

the Medicaid shortfall of a hospital established and operated 

under IC 16-22-2 or IC 16-23 is calculated as follows: STEP ONE: The office shall identify the outpatient hospital services, reimbursable under this article and under the state Medicaid plan, that were provided during the state fiscal year by the hospital. STEP TWO: For the outpatient hospital services identified under STEP ONE, the office shall calculate the payments made under this article and under the state Medicaid plan to the hospital, excluding payments under IC 12-15-16, IC 12-15-17, and IC 12-15-19. STEP THREE: The office shall calculate a reasonable estimate of the amount that would have been paid by the office for the outpatient hospital services described in STEP ONE under Medicare payment principles; and 

(2) 
a hospital's Medicaid shortfall is equal to the amount by which the amount calculated in STEP THREE of subdivision 

(1) 
is greater than the amount calculated in STEP TWO of subdivision (1). 


(g) The actual distribution of the amount calculated under STEP FIVE of subsection (b) to a hospital established and operated under IC 16-22-8 shall be made under the terms and conditions provided for the hospital in the state plan for medical assistance. Payment to a hospital under STEP FIVE of subsection (b) is not a condition precedent to the tender of payments to hospitals under STEP SEVEN of subsection (b). As added by P.L.120-2002, SEC.14. Amended by P.L.255-2003, SEC.17; P.L.212-2007, SEC.2; P.L.218-2007, SEC.12; P.L.229-2011, SEC.129; P.L.205-2013, SEC.191. 

IC 12-15-15-1.5 Additional reimbursements to certain hospitals; appeal of amount of distribution 
Sec. 1.5. (a) This section applies to a hospital that: 
(1) 
is licensed under IC 16-21; 

(2) 
is not a unit of state or local government; and 

(3) 
is not owned or operated by a unit of state or local 


government. This section does not apply during the period that the office is assessing a hospital fee authorized by IC 16-21-10. 
(b) For a state fiscal year ending after June 30, 2003, and before July 1, 2007, in addition to reimbursement received under section 1 of this chapter, a hospital eligible under this section is entitled to reimbursement in an amount calculated as follows: 
STEP ONE: The office shall identify the total inpatient hospital services and the total outpatient hospital services, reimbursable under this article and under the state Medicaid plan, that were provided during the state fiscal year by the hospitals described in subsection (a). STEP TWO: For the total inpatient hospital services and the total outpatient hospital services identified under STEP ONE, the office shall calculate the aggregate payments made under this article and under the state Medicaid plan to hospitals described in subsection (a), excluding payments under IC 12-15-16, IC 12-15-17, and IC 12-15-19. STEP THREE: The office shall calculate a reasonable estimate of the amount that would have been paid in the aggregate by the office for the inpatient hospital services and the outpatient hospital services identified in STEP ONE under Medicare payment principles. STEP FOUR: Subtract the amount calculated under STEPTWO from the amount calculated under STEP THREE. STEP FIVE: Distribute an amount equal to the amount calculated under STEP FOUR to the eligible hospitals described in subsection (a) as follows: 
(A) 
Subject to the availability of funds under IC 12-15-20-2(8)(D) to serve as the nonfederal share of such payment, the first ten million dollars ($10,000,000) of the amount calculated under STEP FOUR for a state fiscal year shall be paid to a hospital described in subsection (a) that has more than sixty thousand (60,000) Medicaid inpatient days. 

(B) 
Following the payment to the hospital under clause (A) and subject to the availability of funds under IC 12-15-20-2(8)(D) to serve as the nonfederal share of such payments, the remaining amount calculated under STEP FOUR for a state fiscal year shall be paid to all hospitals described in subsection (a). The payments shall be made on a pro rata basis based on the hospitals' Medicaid inpatient days or other payment methodology approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. For purposes of this 

clause, a hospital's Medicaid inpatient days are the hospital's in-state and paid Medicaid fee for service and managed care days for the state fiscal year for which services are identified under STEP ONE, as determined by the office. 

(C) 
Subject to IC 12-15-20.7, in the event the entirety of the amount calculated under STEP FOUR is not distributed following the payments made under clauses (A) and (B), the remaining amount may be paid to hospitals described in subsection (a) that are eligible under this clause. A hospital is eligible for a payment under this clause only if the nonfederal share of the hospital's payment is provided by or on behalf of the hospital. The remaining amount shall be paid to those eligible hospitals: 

(i) 
on a pro rata basis in relation to all hospitals eligible under this clause based on the hospitals' Medicaid inpatient days; or 

(ii) 
other payment methodology determined by the office and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 




(c) As used in this subsection, "Medicaid supplemental payments" means Medicaid payments for hospitals that are in addition to Medicaid fee-for-service payments, Medicaid risk-based managed care payments, and Medicaid disproportionate share payments, and that are included in the Medicaid state plan, including Medicaid safety-net payments, and payments made under this section and sections 1.1, 1.3, 9, and 9.5 of this chapter. For a state fiscal year ending after June 30, 2007, in addition to the reimbursement received under section 1 of this chapter, a hospital eligible under this section is entitled to reimbursement in an amount calculated as follows: 
STEP ONE: The office shall identify the total inpatient hospital services and the total outpatient hospital services reimbursable under this article and under the state Medicaid plan that were provided during the state fiscal year for all hospitals described in subsection (a). STEP TWO: For the total inpatient hospital services and the total outpatient hospital services identified in STEP ONE, the office shall calculate the total payments made under this article and under the state Medicaid plan to all hospitals described in subsection (a). A calculation under this STEP excludes a payment made under the following: 
(A) 
IC 12-15-16. 

(B) 
IC 12-15-17. 


(C) IC 12-15-19. STEP THREE: The office shall calculate, under Medicare payment principles, a reasonable estimate of the total amount that would have been paid by the office for the inpatient hospital services and the outpatient hospital services identified in STEP ONE. 
STEP FOUR: Subtract the amount calculated under STEP TWO from the amount calculated under STEP THREE. STEP FIVE: Distribute an amount equal to the amount calculated under STEP FOUR to the eligible hospitals described in subsection (a) as follows: 
(A) 
As used in this clause, "Medicaid inpatient days" are the hospital's in-state paid Medicaid fee for service and risk-based managed care days for the state fiscal year for which services are identified under STEP ONE, as determined by the office. Subject to the availability of funds transferred to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under STEP FOUR of IC 12-16-7.5-4.5(c) and remaining in the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-15-20-2(8)(G) to serve as the nonfederal share of the payments, the amount calculated under STEP FOUR for a state fiscal year shall be paid to all hospitals described in subsection (a). The payments shall be made on a pro rata basis, based on the hospitals' Medicaid inpatient days or in accordance with another payment methodology determined by the office and approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 

(B) 
Subject to IC 12-15-20.7, if the entire amount calculated under STEP FOUR is not distributed following the payments made under clause (A), the remaining amount shall be paid as described in clauses (C) and (D) to a hospital that is described in subsection (a) and that is described as eligible under this clause. A hospital is eligible for a payment under clause (C) only if the hospital: 

(i) 
has less than sixty thousand (60,000) Medicaid inpatient days annually; 

(ii) 
was eligible for Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in the state fiscal year ending June 30, 1998, or the hospital met the office's Medicaid disproportionate share payment criteria based upon state fiscal year 1998 data and received a Medicaid disproportionate share payment for the state fiscal year ending June 30, 2001; and 




(iii) received a Medicaid disproportionate share payment under IC 12-15-19-2.1 for state fiscal years 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. 
The payment amount under clause (C) for an eligible hospital is subject to the availability of the nonfederal share of the hospital's payment being provided by the hospital or on behalf of the hospital. 
(C) 
For state fiscal years ending after June 30, 2007, but before July 1, 2009, payments to eligible hospitals described in clause (B) shall be made as follows: 

(i) 
The payment to an eligible hospital that merged two (2) 

hospitals under a single Medicaid provider number effective January 1, 2004, shall equal one hundred percent (100%) of the hospital's hospital-specific limit for the state fiscal year ending June 30, 2005, when the payment is combined with any Medicaid disproportionate share payment made under IC 12-15-19-2.1, Medicaid, and other Medicaid supplemental payments, paid or to be paid to the hospital for a state fiscal year. 

(ii) 
The payment to an eligible hospital described in clause 

(B) 
other than a hospital described in item (i) shall equal one hundred percent (100%) of the hospital's hospital specific limit for the state fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, when the payment is combined with any Medicaid disproportionate share payment made under IC 12-15-19-2.1, Medicaid, and other Medicaid supplemental payments, paid or to be paid to the hospital for a state fiscal year. 



(D) 
For state fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2009, payments to an eligible hospital described in clause (B) shall be made in a manner determined by the office. 

(E) 
Subject to IC 12-15-20.7, if the entire amount calculated under STEP FOUR is not distributed following the payments made under clause (A) and clauses (C) or (D), the remaining amount may be paid as described in clause (F) to a hospital described in subsection (a) that is described as eligible under this clause. A hospital is eligible for a payment for a state fiscal year under clause (F) if the hospital: 

(i) 
is eligible to receive Medicaid disproportionate share payments for the state fiscal year for which the Medicaid disproportionate share payment is attributable under IC 12-15-19-2.1, for a state fiscal year ending after June 30, 2007; and 

(ii) 
does not receive a payment under clauses (C) or (D) 




for the state fiscal year. A payment to a hospital under this clause is subject to the availability of nonfederal matching funds. 
(F) Payments to eligible hospitals described in clause (E) shall be made: 
(i) 
to best use federal matching funds available for hospitals that are eligible for Medicaid disproportionate share payments under IC 12-15-19-2.1; and 

(ii) 
by using a methodology that allocates available funding under this clause, Medicaid supplemental payments, and payments under IC 12-15-19-2.1, in a manner in which all hospitals eligible under clause (E) receive payments in a manner that takes into account the situation of eligible hospitals that have historically qualified for Medicaid disproportionate share payments 


and ensures that payments for eligible hospitals are equitable. 
(G) If the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not approve the payment methodologies in clauses (A) through (F), the office may implement alternative payment methodologies that are eligible for federal financial participation to implement a program consistent with the payments for hospitals described in clauses (A) through (F). 
(d) A hospital described in subsection (a) may appeal under IC 4-21.5 the amount determined by the office to be paid to the hospital under STEP FIVE of subsections (b) or (c). The distribution to other hospitals under STEP FIVE of subsection (b) or (c) may not be delayed due to an administrative appeal or judicial review instituted by a hospital under this subsection. If necessary, the office may make a partial distribution to the other eligible hospitals under STEP FIVE of subsection (b) or (c) pending the completion of a hospital's administrative appeal or judicial review, at which time the remaining portion of the payments due to the eligible hospitals shall be made. A partial distribution may be based on estimates and trends calculated by the office. As added by P.L.255-2003, SEC.18.

Sec. 9. (a) For purposes of this section and IC 12-16-7.5-4.5, a payable claim is attributed to a county if the payable claim is submitted to the division by a hospital licensed under IC 16-21-2 for payment under IC 12-16-7.5 for care provided by the hospital to an individual who qualifies for the hospital care for the indigent program under IC 12-16-3.5-1 or IC 12-16-3.5-2 and: 
(1) 
who is a resident of the county; 

(2) 
who is not a resident of the county and for whom the onset of the medical condition that necessitated the care occurred in the county; or 

(3)

(c) 
Except as provided in section 9.8 of this chapter and subject to section 9.6 of this chapter, for a state fiscal year, the office shall pay to a hospital referred to in subsection (b) an amount equal to the amount, based on information obtained from the division and the calculations and allocations made under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5, that the office determines for the hospital under STEP SIX of the following STEPS: 


STEP ONE: Identify: 
(A) each hospital that submitted to the division one (1) or more payable claims under IC 12-16-7.5 during the state fiscal year; and 
(B) the county to which each payable claim is attributed. STEP TWO: For each county identified in STEP ONE, identify: 
(A) 
each hospital that submitted to the division one (1) or more payable claims under IC 12-16-7.5 attributed to the county during the state fiscal year; and 

(B) 
the total amount of all hospital payable claims submitted to the division under IC 12-16-7.5 attributed to the county during the state fiscal year. 


STEP THREE: For each county identified in STEP ONE, identify the amount of county funds transferred to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5. STEP FOUR: For each hospital identified in STEP ONE, with respect to each county identified in STEP ONE, calculate the hospital's percentage share of the county's funds transferred to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5. Each hospital's percentage share is based on the total amount of the hospital's payable claims submitted to the division under IC 12-16-7.5 attributed to the county during the state fiscal year, calculated as a percentage of the total amount of all hospital payable claims submitted to the division under IC 12-16-7.5 attributed to the county during the state fiscal year. STEP FIVE: Subject to subsection (j), for each hospital identified in STEP ONE, with respect to each county identified in STEP ONE, multiply the hospital's percentage share calculated under STEP FOUR by the amount of the county's funds transferred to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5.

(e) 
A hospital's payment under subsection (c) or (d) is in the form of a Medicaid supplemental payment. The amount of a hospital's Medicaid supplemental payment is subject to the availability of funding for the non-federal share of the payment under subsection (f). The office shall make the payments under subsection (c) and (d) before December 15 that next succeeds the end of the state fiscal year.

(g) 
The amount of a county's transferred funds available to be used to fund the non-federal share of a payment to a hospital under subsection (c) is an amount that bears the same proportion to the total amount of funds of the county transferred to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5 that the total amount of the hospital's payable claims under IC 12-16-7.5 attributed to the county submitted to the division during the state fiscal year bears to the total amount of all hospital payable claims under IC 12-16-7.5 attributed to the county submitted to the division during the state fiscal year. 

(h) 
Any county's funds identified in subsection (g) that remain after the non-federal share of a hospital's payment has been funded are available to serve as the non-federal share of a payment to a hospital under section 9.5 of this chapter. 

(i) 
For purposes of this section, "payable claim" has the meaning set forth in IC 12-16-7.5-2.5(b)(1). 


(j) For purposes of subsection (c):

the amount of a payable claim is an amount equal to the amount the hospital would have received under the state's fee-for-service Medicaid reimbursement principles for the hospital care for which the payable claim is submitted under IC 12-16-7.5 if the individual receiving the hospital care had been a Medicaid enrollee; and 

(2) 
a payable hospital claim under IC 12-16-7.5 includes a payable claim under IC 12-16-7.5 for the hospital's care submitted by an individual or entity other than the hospital, to the extent permitted under the hospital care for the indigent program. 


(k) The amount calculated under STEP FIVE of subsection (c) for a hospital with respect to a county may not exceed the total amount of the hospital's payable claims attributed to the county during the state fiscal year.

is entitled to a payment under subsection (c). 
(c) Subject to section 9.6 of this chapter, for a state fiscal year, the office shall pay to a hospital referred to in subsection (b) an amount equal to the amount, based on information obtained from the division and the calculations and allocations made under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5, that the office determines for the hospital under STEP EIGHT of the following STEPS: 
STEP ONE: Identify each county whose transfer of funds to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5 for the state fiscal year was less than the total amount of all hospital payable claims attributed to the county and submitted to the division during the state fiscal year. STEP TWO: For each county identified in STEP ONE, calculate the difference between the amount of funds of the county transferred to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5 and the total amount of all hospital payable claims attributed to the county and submitted to the division during the state fiscal year. 
STEP THREE: Calculate the sum of the amounts calculated for the counties under STEP TWO. STEP FOUR: Identify each hospital whose payment under section 9(c) of this chapter was less than the total amount of the hospital's payable claims under IC 12-16-7.5 submitted by the hospital to the division during the state fiscal year. STEP FIVE: Calculate for each hospital identified in STEP FOUR the difference between the hospital's payment under section 9(c) of this chapter and the total amount of the hospital's payable claims under IC 12-16-7.5 submitted by the hospital to the division during the state fiscal year. STEP SIX: Calculate the sum of the amounts calculated for each of the hospitals under STEP FIVE. STEP SEVEN: For each hospital identified in STEP FOUR, calculate the hospital's percentage share of the amount calculated under STEP SIX. Each hospital's percentage share is based on the amount calculated for the hospital under STEP FIVE calculated as a percentage of the sum calculated under STEP SIX. STEP EIGHT: For each hospital identified in STEP FOUR, multiply the hospital's percentage share calculated under STEP SEVEN by the sum calculated under STEP THREE. The amount calculated under this STEP for a hospital may not exceed the amount by which the hospital's total payable claims under IC 12-16-7.5 submitted during the state fiscal year exceeded the amount of the hospital's payment under section 9(c) of this chapter. 
(d) 
For state fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2007, a hospital that received a payment determined under STEP EIGHT of subsection (c) for the state fiscal year ending June 30, 2007, shall be paid an amount equal to the amount determined for the hospital under STEP EIGHT of subsection (c) for the state fiscal year ending June 30, 2007. 

(e) 
A hospital's payment under subsection (c) or (d) is in the form of a Medicaid supplemental payment. The amount of the hospital's add-on payment is subject to the availability of funding for the nonfederal share of the payment under subsection (f). The office shall make the payments under subsection (c) or (d) before December 15 that next succeeds the end of the state fiscal year. 

(f) 
The nonfederal share of a payment to a hospital under subsection (c) or (d) is derived from funds transferred to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5 and not expended under section 9 of this chapter. 

(g) 
Except as provided in subsection (h), the office may not make a payment under this section until the payments due under section 9 of this chapter for the state fiscal year have been made. 

(h) 
If a hospital appeals a decision by the office regarding the hospital's payment under section 9 of this chapter, the office may 


make payments under this section before all payments due under section 9 of this chapter are made if: 
(1) 
a delay in one (1) or more payments under section 9 of this chapter resulted from the appeal; and 

(2) 
the office determines that making payments under this section while the appeal is pending will not unreasonably affect the interests of hospitals eligible for a payment under this section. 


(i) Any funds transferred to the Medicaid indigent care trust fund under IC 12-16-7.5-4.5 remaining after payments are made under this section shall be used as provided in IC 12-15-20-2(8). 
(j) For purposes of subsection (c): 
(1) 
"payable claim" has the meaning set forth in IC 12-16-7.5-2.5(b); 

(2) 
the amount of a payable claim is an amount equal to the amount the hospital would have received under the state's fee-for-service Medicaid reimbursement principles for the hospital care for which the payable claim is submitted under IC 12-16-7.5 if the individual receiving the hospital care had been a Medicaid enrollee; and 

(3) 
a payable hospital claim under IC 12-16-7.5 includes a payable claim under IC 12-16-7.5 for the hospital's care submitted by an individual or entity other than the hospital, to the extent permitted under the hospital care for the indigent program.

Sec. 1. (a) A provider that is an acute care hospital licensed under IC 16-21, a state mental health institution under IC 12-24-1-3, or a private psychiatric institution licensed under IC 12-25 is a disproportionate share provider if the provider meets either of the following conditions: 
(1) 
The provider's Medicaid inpatient utilization rate is at least one (1) standard deviation above the mean Medicaid inpatient utilization rate for providers receiving Medicaid payments in Indiana. However, the Medicaid inpatient utilization rate of providers whose low income utilization rate exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) must be excluded in calculating the statewide mean Medicaid inpatient utilization rate. 

(2) 
The provider's low income utilization rate exceeds twenty-five percent (25%). 


(b) 
An acute care hospital licensed under 16-21 is a municipal disproportionate share provider if the hospital: 

(1) 
has a Medicaid utilization rate greater than one percent (1%); and 

(2) 
is established and operated under IC 16-22-2 or IC 16-23. 


(c) A community mental health center: 
(1) 
that is identified in IC 12-29-2-1; 

(2)

(ii) 
the amount of the cash subsidies received directly from state and local governments, including payments made under the hospital care for the indigent program (IC 12-16-2) (before its repeal) and IC 12-16-2.5; and 



(B) 
the denominator is the total amount of the provider's 


patient revenues paid to the provider, including cash subsidies; and

Chapter 19. Disproportionate Share Providers; Enhanced Disproportionate Share Payments 
IC 12-15-19-1 Enhanced disproportionate share payment methodology for state fiscal years ending June 30, 1998, and June 30, 1999; limits on basic and enhanced disproportionate share payments to hospitals 
Sec. 1. (a) For the state fiscal years ending on June 30, 1998, and June 30, 1999, the office shall develop an enhanced disproportionate share payment methodology that ensures that each enhanced disproportionate share provider receives total disproportionate share payments that do not exceed its hospital specific limit specified in subsection (c). The methodology developed by the office shall ensure that hospitals operated by or affiliated with the governmental entities described in IC 12-15-18-5.1(a) receive, to the extent practicable, disproportionate share payments equal to their hospital specific limits. The funds shall be distributed to qualifying hospitals in proportion to each qualifying hospital's percentage of the total net hospital specific limits of all qualifying hospitals. A hospital's net hospital specific limit for state fiscal years ending on or before June 30, 1999, is determined under STEP THREE of the following formula: 
STEP ONE: Determine the hospital's hospital specific limit 
under subsection (c). 
STEP TWO: Subtract basic disproportionate share payments 
received by the hospital under IC 12-15-16-6 from the amount 
determined under STEP ONE. 
STEP THREE: Subtract intergovernmental transfers paid by or 
on behalf of the hospital from the amount determined under 
STEP TWO. 
(b) The office shall include a provision in each amendment to the state plan regarding disproportionate share payments, municipal disproportionate share payments, and community mental health center disproportionate share payments that the office submits to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that, as provided in 42 CFR 447.297(d)(3), allows the state to make additional disproportionate share expenditures, municipal disproportionate share expenditures, and community mental health center disproportionate share expenditures after the end of each federal fiscal year that relate back to a prior federal fiscal year. Each eligible hospital or community mental health center may receive an additional disproportionate share adjustment if: 
(1) 
additional intergovernmental transfers or certifications are made as authorized under IC 12-15-18-5.1; and 

(2) 
the total disproportionate share payments to: 

(A) 
each individual hospital; and 

(B) 
all qualifying hospitals in the aggregate; 




do not exceed the limits provided by federal law and regulation. 
(c) For state fiscal years ending on or before June 30, 1999, total basic and enhanced disproportionate share payments to a hospital under this chapter and IC 12-15-16 shall not exceed the hospital specific limit provided under 42 U.S.C. 1396r-4(g). The hospital specific limit for state fiscal years ending on or before June 30, 1999, shall be determined by the office taking into account any data provided by each hospital for each hospital's most recent fiscal year (or in cases where a change in fiscal year causes the most recent fiscal period to be less than twelve (12) months, twelve (12) months of data ending at the end of the most recent fiscal year) as certified to the office by: 
(1) 
an independent certified public accounting firm if the hospital is a hospital licensed under IC 16-21 that qualifies under IC 12-15-16-1(a); or 

(2) 
the budget agency if the hospital is a state mental health institution listed under IC 12-24-1-3 that qualifies under either IC 12-15-16-1(a)(1) or IC 12-15-16-1(a)(2); 


in accordance with this subsection and federal laws, regulations, and guidelines. The hospital specific limit for state fiscal years ending after June 30, 1999, shall be determined by the office using the methodology described in section 2.1(b) of this chapter.

IC 12-15-19-2.1 Disproportionate share payment methodologyfor state fiscalyears ending on or after June 30, 2000; limits on total disproportionate share payments to hospitals 
Sec. 2.1. (a) This section does not apply during the period that the office is assessing a hospital fee authorized by IC 16-21-10. For each state fiscal year ending on or after June 30, 2000, the office shall develop a disproportionate share payment methodology that ensures that each hospital qualifying for disproportionate share payments under IC 12-15-16-1(a) timely receives total disproportionate share payments that do not exceed the hospital's hospital specific limit provided under 42 U.S.C. 1396r-4(g). The payment methodology as developed by the office must: 
(1) 
maximize disproportionate share hospital payments to qualifying hospitals to the extent practicable; 

(2) 
take into account the situation of those qualifying hospitals 

that have historically qualified for Medicaid disproportionate share payments; and 

(3) 
ensure that payments for qualifying hospitals are equitable. 


(b) Total disproportionate share payments to a hospital under this chapter shall not exceed the hospital specific limit provided under 42 
U.S.C. 1396r-4(g). The hospital specific limit for a state fiscal year shall be determined by the office taking into account data provided by each hospital that is considered reliable by the office based on a system of periodic audits, the use of trending factors, and an appropriate base year determined by the office. The office may require independent certification of data provided by a hospital to determine the hospital's hospital specific limit. 
(c) The office shall include a provision in each amendment to the state plan regarding Medicaid disproportionate share payments that the office submits to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that, as provided in 42 CFR 447.297(d)(3), allows the state to make additional disproportionate share expenditures after the end of each federal fiscal year that relate back to a prior federal fiscal year. However, the total disproportionate share payments to: 
(1) each individual hospital; and 
(2) all qualifying hospitals in the aggregate; may not exceed the limits provided by federal law and regulation. As added by P.L.113-2000, SEC.12. Amended by P.L.283-2001, SEC.24; P.L.66-2002, SEC.10; P.L.212-2007, SEC.8; P.L.218-2007, SEC.18; P.L.229-2011, SEC.136; P.L.205-2013, SEC.199.

IC 12-15-19-6 Deposits in fund; insufficiency; suspension or reduction of payments to eligible institutions 
Sec. 6. (a) This section does not apply during the period that the office is assessing a hospital fee authorized by IC 16-21-10. The office is not required to make disproportionate share payments under this chapter from the Medicaid indigent care trust fund established by IC 12-15-20-1 until the fund has received sufficient deposits, including intergovernmental transfers of funds and certifications of expenditures, to permit the office to make the state's share of the required disproportionate share payments. 
(b) For state fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2006, if: 
(1) 
sufficient deposits have not been received; or 

(2) 
the statewide Medicaid disproportionate share allocation is insufficient to provide federal financial participation for the entirety of all eligible disproportionate share hospitals' hospital-specific limits; 


the office shall reduce disproportionate share payments made under IC 12-15-19-2.1 and Medicaid safety-net payments made in accordance with the Medicaid state plan to eligible institutions using an equitable methodology consistent with subsection (c). 
(c) 
For state fiscal years beginning after June 30, 2006, payments reduced under this section shall, in accordance with the Medicaid state plan, be made: 

(1) 
to best utilize federal matching funds available for hospitals eligible for Medicaid disproportionate share payments under IC 12-15-19-2.1; and 

(2) 
by utilizing a methodology that allocates available funding under this subdivision, and Medicaid supplemental payments as defined in IC 12-15-15-1.5, in a manner that all hospitals eligible for Medicaid disproportionate share payments under IC 12-15-19-2.1 receive payments using a methodology that: 

(A) 
takes into account the situation of the eligible hospitals that have historicallyqualified for Medicaid disproportionate share payments; and 

(B) 
ensures that payments for eligible hospitals are equitable. 





(d) 
The percentage reduction shall be sufficient to ensure that payments do not exceed the statewide Medicaid disproportionate share allocation or the amounts that can be financed with: 

(1) 
the amount transferred from the hospital care for the indigent trust fund; 

(2) 
other intergovernmental transfers;

A provider that qualifies as a municipal disproportionate share provider under IC 12-15-16-1 shall receive a disproportionate share adjustment, subject to the provider's hospitalspecific limits described in subsection (b), as follows: 
(1) 
For each state fiscal year ending on or after June 30, 1998, an amount shall be distributed to each provider qualifying as a municipal disproportionate share provider under IC 12-15-16-1. The total amount distributed shall not exceed the sum of all hospital specific limits for all qualifying providers. 

(2) 
For each municipal disproportionate share provider qualifying under IC 12-15-16-1 to receive disproportionate share payments, the amount in subdivision (1) shall be reduced by the amount of disproportionate share payments received by the provider under IC 12-15-16-6 or sections 1 or 2.1 of this chapter. The office shall develop a disproportionate share provider payment methodologythat ensures that each municipal disproportionate share provider receives disproportionate share payments that do not exceed the provider's hospital specific limit specified in subsection (b). The methodology developed by the office shall ensure that a municipal disproportionate share provider receives, to the extent possible, disproportionate share payments that, when combined with any other disproportionate share payments owed to the provider, equals the provider's hospital specific limits. 


(b) 
Total disproportionate share payments to a provider under this chapter and IC 12-15-16 shall not exceed the hospital specific limit provided under 42 U.S.C. 1396r-4(g). The hospital specific limit for state fiscal years ending on or before June 30, 1999, shall be determined by the office taking into account data provided by each hospital for the hospital's most recent fiscal year or, if a change in fiscal year causes the most recent fiscal period to be less than twelve 

(12)
 months, twelve (12) months of data compiled to the end of the provider's fiscal year that ends within the most recent state fiscal year, as certified to the office by an independent certified public accounting firm. The hospital specific limit for all state fiscal years ending on or after June 30, 2000, shall be determined by the office taking into account data provided by each hospital that is deemed reliable by the office based on a system of periodic audits, the use of trending factors, and an appropriate base year determined by the office. The office may require independent certification of data 


provided by a hospital to determine the hospital's hospital specific limit.
