IC 4-21.5-5-9 Stay of order pending court decision 
Sec. 9. (a) If a petition for judicial review concerns a matter other than an assessment or determination of tax due or claimed to be due the state, and the law concerning the agency whose order is being reviewed does not preclude a stay of the order by the court, the person seeking the review may seek, by filing a verified petition, an order of the court staying the action of the agency pending decision by the court. The court may enter an order staying the agency order pending a final determination if: 
(1) 
the court finds that the petition for review and the petition for a stay order show a reasonable probability that the order or determination appealed from is invalid or illegal; and 

(2) 
a bond is filed that is conditioned upon the due prosecution of the proceeding for review and that the petitioner will pay all court costs and abide by the order of the agency if it is not set aside. The bond must be in the amount and with the surety approved by the court. However, the amount of the bond must be at least five hundred dollars ($500). 


(b) If a petition for review concerns a revocation or suspension of a license and the law governing the agency permits a staying of the action of the agency by court order pending judicial review, any stay ordered under subsection (a) is effective during the period of the review and any appeal from the review and until the review is finally determined, unless otherwise ordered by the court granting the stay. If the stay is granted as provided in this section and the determination of the agency is approved on final determination, the revocation or suspension of the license immediately becomes effective.

(1) 
the issue concerns whether a person who was required to be notified by this article of the commencement of a proceeding was notified in substantial compliance with this article; or 

(2) 
the interests of justice would be served by judicial 


resolution of an issue arising from a change in controlling law occurring after the agency action. 
As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. Amended by P.L.35-1987, SEC.21. 

IC 4-21.5-5-11 Fact issues confined to record 
Sec. 11. Judicial review of disputed issues of fact must be confined to the agency record for the agency action supplemented by additional evidence taken under section 12 of this chapter. The court may not try the cause de novo or substitute its judgment for that of the agency. As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. 

IC 4-21.5-5-12 Evidence; remand to agency for further factfinding 
Sec. 12. (a) The court may receive evidence, in addition to that contained in the agency record for judicial review, only if it relates to the validity of the agency action at the time it was taken and is needed to decide disputed issues regarding one (1) or both of the following: 
(1) Improper constitution as a decision-making body or grounds for disqualification of those taking the agency action. 
(2) 
Unlawfulness of procedure or of decision-making process. This subsection applies only if the additional evidence could not, by due diligence, have been discovered and raised in the administrative proceeding giving rise to a proceeding for judicial review. 

(b) 
The court may remand a matter to the agency before final disposition of a petition for review with directions that the agency conduct further factfinding or that the agency prepare an adequate record, if: 

(1) 
the agency failed to prepare or preserve an adequate record; 

(2) 
the agency improperly excluded or omitted evidence from the record; or 

(3) 
a relevant law changed after the agency action and the court determines that the new provision of law may control the outcome. 




As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. 

IC 4-21.5-5-13 Transmittal of agency record; costs; corrections or additions 
Sec. 13. (a) Within thirty (30) days after the filing of the petition, or within further time allowed by the court or by other law, the petitioner shall transmit to the court the original or a certified copy of the agency record for judicial review of the agency action, consisting of: 
(1) 
any agency documents expressing the agency action; 

(2) 
other documents identified by the agency as having been considered by it before its action and used as a basis for its 

action; and 

(3) 
any other material described in this article as the agency record for the type of agency action at issue, subject to this section. 


(b) 
An extension of time in which to file the record shall be granted by the court for good cause shown. Inability to obtain the record from the responsible agency within the time permitted by this section is good cause. Failure to file the record within the time permitted by this subsection, including any extension period ordered by the court, is cause for dismissal of the petition for review by the court, on its own motion, or on petition of any party of record to the proceeding. 

(c) 
Upon a written request by the petitioner, the agency taking the action being reviewed shall prepare the agency record for the petitioner. If part of the record has been preserved without a transcript, the agency shall prepare a transcript for inclusion in the record transmitted to the court, except for portions that the parties to the judicial review proceeding stipulate to omit in accordance with subsection (e). 

(d) 
Notwithstanding IC 5-14-3-8, the agency shall charge the petitioner with the reasonable cost of preparing any necessary copies and transcripts for transmittal to the court, unless a person files with the court, under oath and in writing, the statement described by IC 33-37-3-2. 

(e) 
By stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings, the record may be shortened, summarized, or organized. 

(f) 
The court may tax the cost of preparing transcripts and copies for the record: 

(1) 
against a party to the judicial review proceeding who unreasonably refuses to stipulate to shorten, summarize, or organize the record; or 

(2) 
in accordance with the rules governing civil actions in the courts or other law. 




(g) Additions to the record concerning evidence received under section 12 of this chapter must be made as ordered by the court. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record. As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. Amended by P.L.11-1987, SEC.6; P.L.3-1989, SEC.24; P.L.98-2004, SEC.47. 

IC 4-21.5-5-14 Burden of proof; standards of review 
Sec. 14. (a) The burden of demonstrating the invalidity of agency action is on the party to the judicial review proceeding asserting invalidity. 
(b) 
The validity of agency action shall be determined in accordance with the standards of review provided in this section, as applied to the agency action at the time it was taken. 

(c) 
The court shall make findings of fact on each material issue on which the court's decision is based. 

(d) 
The court shall grant relief under section 15 of this chapter only if it determines that a person seeking judicial relief has been prejudiced by an agency action that is: 

(1) 
arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; 

(2) 
contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; 

(3) 
in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right;

remand the case to the agency for further proceedings; or 

(2) 
compel agency action that has been unreasonably delayed or unlawfully withheld. 


As added by P.L.18-1986, SEC.1. Amended by P.L.35-1987, SEC.23.
