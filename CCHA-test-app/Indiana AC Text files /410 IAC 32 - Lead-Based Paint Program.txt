Affected: IC 16-41-39.8 

Sec. 9. The following post-abatement final visual clearance procedures shall be performed only by a licensed inspector or risk assessor: 
(1)
 Following an abatement and prior to removal of warning signs or other demarcation, a visual inspection shall be completed by an Indiana licensed inspector or risk assessor to determine if deteriorated, painted surfaces or visible amounts of dust, debris, or residue are still present. 

(2)
 If deteriorated painted surfaces or visible amounts of dust debris or residue are present, they must be wet wiped or HEPA vacuumed until such conditions are eliminated prior to the continuation of the clearance procedures. 

(3)
 Following the visual inspection and any post-abatement cleanup required in this rule, clearance sampling for lead-contaminated dust shall be conducted by employing single-surface sampling or composite sampling techniques. 

(4)
 Dust samples on surfaces for clearance purposes shall be taken using documented methodologies that incorporate adequate quality control procedures. 

(5) 
Dust samples for clearance purposes shall be taken within a minimum of one (1) hour after completion of final post-abatement clean-up activities. 

(6)
 The following post-abatement clearance activities shall be conducted as appropriate based upon the extent or manner of abatement activities conducted in or to the target housing or child-occupied facility: 


(A) After conducting an abatement with containment between abated and unabated areas: 
(i)
 one (1) dust sample shall be taken from one (1) interior window sill and from one (1) window trough, if present; 

(ii)
 one (1) dust sample shall be taken from the floors of each of no less than four (4) rooms, hallways, or stairwells within the containment area; and 


(iii) one (1) dust sample shall be taken from the floor outside the containment area. If there are fewer than four (4) rooms, hallways, or stairwells within the containment area, then all rooms, hallways, or stairwells shall be sampled. 
(B) After conducting an abatement with no containment: 
(i)
 two (2) dust samples shall be taken from each of no fewer than four (4) rooms, hallways, or stairwells in the target housing or child-occupied facility; 

(ii)
 one (1) dust sample shall be taken from one (1) interior window sill and one (1) window trough, if present; and 


(iii) one (1) dust sample shall be taken from the floor of each room, hallway, or stairwell selected. If there are fewer than four (4) rooms, hallways, or stairwells within the residential dwelling or child-occupied facility, then all rooms, hallways, or stairwells shall be sampled. 
(C)
 Following an exterior paint abatement, a visible inspection shall be conducted as follows: 

(i)
 All horizontal surfaces in the outdoor living area closest to the abated surface shall be found to be clean of visible dust and debris. 

(ii)
 A visual inspection shall be conducted to determine the presence of paint chips on the dripline or next to the foundation below any exterior surface abated. 


(iii) If paint chips are present, the chips shall be removed from the site and properly disposed of according to all applicable federal, state, and local requirements. 

(D)
 The rooms, hallways, or stairwells selected for sampling shall be selected according to documented methodologies. 

(E)
 The licensed inspector or risk assessor shall compare the residual lead level, as determined by the laboratory analysis, from each single surface dust sample with applicable clearance levels for lead in dust on floors, interior window sills, and window troughs divided by half the number of subsamples in the composite sample. If the residual lead level: 

(i)
 in a single surface dust sample equals or exceeds the applicable clearance levels; or 

(ii)
 in a composite dust sample equals or exceeds the applicable clearance level divided by half the number of 




subsamples in the composite sample; then the sample is a failed sample. All the components represented by the failed sample shall be recleaned and retested until clearance levels are met. 
(F) The clearance levels for lead in dust are as follows: 
(i)
 Forty (40) micrograms per square foot for floors.
