Sec. 1. (a) The definitions in this section apply throughout this rule. 
(b) 
"Board" means the Indiana state board of education. 

(c) 
"College and career pathway" means a flexible sequence of career and academic courses that: 

(1) 
help a student explore and prepare for a specific career area or group of related occupations; and 

(2) 
include progressive exposure to the world of work, with some leading to a certificate recognized by business and industry 


or to dual credits. As a student progresses in a pathway and learns more about a specific career area, the student may remain in the same career area throughout high school, explore an additional career area, or enroll in a multicredit career-technical program designed to help the student develop knowledge and skills related to a specific occupation. 
(d) "Credit" means demonstration of proficiency against the academic standards in a course that meets the following requirements: 
(1) 
The course is an approved course and complies with the approved course description. 

(2) 
For those courses for which Indiana academic standards are defined, the course is consistent with Indiana academic standards. 

(3) 
For those courses for which there is a Core 40 end of course assessment, the required proficiency is at or greater than that 


required to pass the assessment. Multiple credit may not be awarded for the same course unless the approved course description permits multiple credits to be awarded. 
(e) 
"High school diploma" means a certificate of graduation issued by the governing body of a school corporation certifying that the student has satisfied the minimum requirements for graduation from a high school of the school corporation. 

(f) "Semester" means one-half (1/2) of a regular school year. 

(g) 
A "quantitative reasoning" course is a high school course that advances a student's ability to apply mathematics in real-world situations and contexts. A mathematical reasoning course deepens a student's understanding of high school mathematics 

standards. Designation of a non-Core 40 mathematics course as a quantitative reasoning course is subject to approval by the department. 

(h) 
"Priority course list" means the list of priority dual credit liberal arts courses or the list of priority dual credit career and technical education courses published by the Indiana commission for higher education. 

(i) 
"Dual credit courses" are courses in which high school students have the opportunity to earn both high school and college credits. It is recommended that schools offering dual credit courses on the high school campus use a dual credit provider from the preferred provider list as developed by the commission for higher education.
