IC 36-1-6-1 Application of chapter 
Sec. 1. This chapter applies to all municipal corporations having the power to adopt ordinances. As added by Acts 1980, P.L.211, SEC.1. 

IC 36-1-6-2 Action to bring compliance with ordinance conditions; expense as lien against property; enforcement ofdelinquent feesand penalties 
Sec. 2. (a) If a condition violating an ordinance of a municipal corporation exists on real property, employees or contractors of a municipal corporation may enter onto that property and take appropriate action to bring the property into compliance with the ordinance. However, before action to bring compliance may be taken, all persons holding a substantial interest in the property must be given a reasonable opportunity of at least ten (10) days but not more than sixty (60) days to bring the property into compliance. Continuous enforcement orders (as defined in IC 36-7-9-2) can be enforced and liens may be assessed without the need for additional notice. If the municipal corporation takes action to bring compliance, the expenses incurred by the municipal corporation to bring compliance constitute a lien against the property. The lien attaches when notice of the lien is recorded in the office of the county recorder in which the property is located. The lien is superior to all other liens except liens for taxes, in an amount that does not exceed: 
(1) 
ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for real property that: 

(A) 
contains one (1) or more occupied or unoccupied single or double family dwellings or the appurtenances or additions to those dwellings; or 

(B) 
is unimproved; or 



(2) 
twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) for all other real property not described in subdivision (1). 


(b) 
The municipal corporation may issue a bill to the owner of the real property for the costs incurred by the municipal corporation in bringing the property into compliance with the ordinance, including administrative costs and removal costs. 

(c) 
A bill issued under subsection (b) is delinquent if the owner of the real property fails to pay the bill within thirty (30) days after the date of the issuance of the bill. 

(d) 
Whenever a municipal corporation determines it necessary, the officer charged with the collection of fees and penalties for the municipal corporation shall prepare: 

(1) 
a list of delinquent fees and penalties that are enforceable under this section, including: 

(A) 
the name or names of the owner or owners of each lot or 

parcel of real property on which fees are delinquent; 

(B) 
a description of the premises, as shown on the records of 

the county auditor; and 

(C) 
the amount of the delinquent fees and the penalty; or 



(2) 
an instrument for each lot or parcel of real property on which the fees are delinquent. 



(e) 
The officer shall record a copy of each list or each instrument with the county recorder, who shall charge a fee for recording the list or instrument under the fee schedule established in IC 36-2-7-10. 

(f) 
The amount of a lien shall be placed on the tax duplicate by the auditor. The total amount, including any accrued interest, shall be collected in the same manner as delinquent taxes are collected and shall be disbursed to the general fund of the municipal corporation. 

(g)
 A fee is not enforceable as a lien against a subsequent owner of property unless the lien for the fee was recorded with the county recorder before conveyance to the subsequent owner. If the property is conveyed before the lien is recorded, the municipal corporation shall notify the person who owned the property at the time the fee became payable. The notice must inform the person that payment, including penalty fees for delinquencies, is due not later than fifteen 

(15) 
days after the date of the notice. If payment is not received within one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of the notice, the amount due may be considered a bad debt loss. 

(h) The municipal corporation shall release: 
(1) liens filed with the county recorder after the recorded date of conveyance of the property; and 

(2) 
delinquent fees incurred by the seller; upon receipt of a written demand from the purchaser or a representative of the title insurance company or the title insurance company's agent that issued a title insurance policy to the purchaser. The demand must state that the delinquent fees were not incurred by the purchaser as a user, lessee, or previous owner and that the purchaser has not been paid by the seller for the delinquent fees. 


(i) The county auditor shall remove the fees, penalties, and service charges that were not recorded before a recorded conveyance to a subsequent owner upon receipt of a copy of the written demand under subsection (h).
