(o) 
Pool water shall be tested for the following: 

(1) 
pH and disinfectant residuals daily before the pool is open for use and at least one (1) other time during the hours of pool use. 

(2) 
Combined chlorine at least twice a week when chlorine is used.

All results shall be recorded. 



(r) 
If electronic monitoring devices are used, the accuracy of the device must be checked as required by the manufacturer or compared for accuracy at least once per week with a test kit. Use of oxidation reduction potential (ORP) controllers does not negate the manual daily testing requirement for disinfectant residuals.

Sec. 44. (a) In the event that a solid stool or full stomach vomit is identified in the pool or spa water, the following steps are required: 
(1) 
The pool shall be cleared of all patrons and close all affected pools or spas operating a common filtration system and keep closed during the sanitation procedure. 

(2) 
The solid fecal material or vomit shall be removed using a net or scoop.

length of time necessary to attain a CT inactivation value of forty-five (45). When chlorine stabilizers are present in pool water, the pool shall be closed until four (4) ppm of free disinfectant must be present in the pool water for a minimum of twenty-five (25) minutes as measured at poolside or the length of time necessary to attain a CT inactivation value of one hundred (100).

Spas only may be completely drained to an approved sewage disposal system other than a public sewer. Stabilized chlorine cannot be used to raise the free chlorine residual. When chlorine stabilizers are present in the pool water, the pool shall be closed, the pH lowered to 6.5, and a forty (40) ppm of free disinfectant must be present in the pool water for a minimum of thirty (30) hours as measured at poolside. 

(6)

(8) 
Filters shall be backwashed to waste and filter material replenished as necessary.

Authority: IC 16-19-3-4; IC 16-19-3-5 
Affected: IC 16-19-3-4 
Sec. 10. "Densic material" means relatively unaltered materials (do not meet requirements for any other named diagnostic horizons or any other diagnostic soil characteristic) that have a noncemented rupture resistance class. The bulk density or the organization is such that roots cannot enter, except in cracks. These are mostly earthy materials, such as till, volcanic mudflows, and some mechanicallycompacted materials. Some noncemented rock can be densic materials if they are dense or resistant enough to keep roots from entering, except in cracks. Densic materials are noncemented and thus differ from paralithic materials and the material below a lithic contact, both of which are cemented. Densic materials have, at their upper boundary, a densic contact if they have no cracks or if the spacing of cracks that roots can enter is ten (10) centimeters (cm) or more. These materials can be used to differentiate soil series if the materials are within the series control section.
