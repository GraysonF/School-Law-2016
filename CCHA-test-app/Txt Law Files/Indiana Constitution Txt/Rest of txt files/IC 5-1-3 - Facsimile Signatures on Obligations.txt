Sec. 2. (a) Whenever any existing statute requires the manual execution, attesting or authentication of any obligation issued by any public entity named in IC 5-1-1-1 by one (1) or more officials or persons, facsimile signatures of such officials or persons may be used instead of and with the same force and effect as manually executing such obligations.

(b) Any obligation executed by the facsimile signature of officials or persons is valid and binding, if the officials or persons satisfied the provisions of the statute under which the obligation is issued on the date that the signature was printed on the obligation, even if the obligation is delivered after the official or person whose facsimile signature appears thereon no longer satisfies the provisions of the statute. (Formerly: Acts 1971, P.L.40, SEC.1.) As amended by P.L.44-1983, SEC.2.
