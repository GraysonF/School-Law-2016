Sec. 4. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the proper officers of a political subdivision shall appropriate funds in such a manner that the expenditures for a year do not exceed its budget for that year as finally determined under this article. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) 

IC 6-1.1-18-5 Proposed additional appropriations; public hearing 
Sec. 5. (a) If the proper officers of a political subdivision desire to appropriate more money for a particular year than the amount prescribed in the budget for that year as finally determined under this article, they shall give notice of their proposed additional appropriation. The notice shall state the time and place at which a public hearing will be held on the proposal. The notice shall be given once in accordance with IC 5-3-1-2(b). 
(b) 
If the additional appropriation by the political subdivision is made from a fund that receives: 

(1) distributions from the motor vehicle highway account established under IC 8-14-1-1 or the local road and street account established under IC 8-14-2-4; or 

(2) 
revenue from property taxes levied under IC 6-1.1; the political subdivision must report the additional appropriation to the department of local government finance. If the additional appropriation is made from a fund described under this subsection, subsections (f), (g), (h), and (i) apply to the political subdivision. 

(c) 
However, if the additional appropriation is not made from a fund described under subsection (b), subsections (f), (g), (h), and (i) do not apply to the political subdivision. Subsections (f), (g), (h), and 

(i) 
do not apply to an additional appropriation made from the cumulative bridge fund if the appropriation meets the requirements under IC 8-16-3-3(c). 

(d) 
A political subdivision may make an additional appropriation without approval of the department of local government finance if the additional appropriation is made from a fund that is not described under subsection (b). However, the fiscal officer of the political subdivision shall report the additional appropriation to the department of local government finance. 

(e) 
After the public hearing, the proper officers of the political subdivision shall file a certified copy of their final proposal and any other relevant information to the department of local government finance. 

(f)
 When the department of local government finance receives a certified copy of a proposal for an additional appropriation under subsection (e), the department shall determine whether sufficient funds are available or will be available for the proposal. The determination shall be made in writing and sent to the political subdivision not more than fifteen (15) days after the department of local government finance receives the proposal. 

(g) 
In making the determination under subsection (f), the department of local government finance shall limit the amount of the additional appropriation to revenues available, or to be made available, which have not been previously appropriated. 

(h) 
If the department of local government finance disapproves an additional appropriation under subsection (f), the department shall specify the reason for its disapproval on the determination sent to the political subdivision. 

(i) 
A political subdivision may request a reconsideration of a determination of the department of local government finance under this section by filing a written request for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration must: 


(1) be filed with the department of local government finance within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of the determination by the political subdivision; and 
(2) 
state with reasonable specificity the reason for the request. The department of local government finance must act on a request for reconsideration within fifteen (15) days of receiving the request. 

(j) 
This subsection applies to an additional appropriation by a political subdivision that must have the political subdivision's annual appropriations and annual tax levy adopted by a city, town, or county fiscal body under IC 6-1.1-17-20 or IC 36-1-23 or by a legislative or fiscal body under IC 36-3-6-9. The fiscal or legislative body of the city, town, or county that adopted the political subdivision's annual appropriation and annual tax levy must adopt the additional appropriation by ordinance before the department of local government finance may approve the additional appropriation. 


(k) This subsection applies to a public library that is not required to submit the public library's budgets, tax rates, and tax levies for binding review and approval under IC 6-1.1-17-20. If a public library subject to this subsection proposes to make an additional appropriation for a year, and the additional appropriation would result in the budget for the library for that year increasing (as compared to the previous year) by a percentage that is greater than the result of the assessed value growth quotient determined under IC 6-1.1-18.5-2 for the calendar year minus one (1), the additional appropriation must first be approved by the city, town, or county fiscal body described in IC 6-1.1-17-20.3(c) or IC 6-1.1-17-20(d), as appropriate. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) As amended by Acts 1981, P.L.46, SEC.2; P.L.69-1983, SEC.5; P.L.57-1991, SEC.1; P.L.17-1995, SEC.4; P.L.90-2002, SEC.161; P.L.137-2012, SEC.29; P.L.184-2015, SEC.9; P.L.184-2016, SEC.13.

Sec. 6. (a) The proper officers of a political subdivision may transfer money from one major budget classification to another within a department or office if: 
(1) 
they determine that the transfer is necessary; 

(2) 
the transfer does not require the expenditure of more money than the total amount set out in the budget as finally determined under this article; and 

(3) 
the transfer is made at a regular public meeting and by proper ordinance or resolution. 


(b) A transfer may be made under this section without notice and without the approval of the department of local government finance. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) As amended by P.L.57-1991, SEC.2; P.L.90-2002, SEC.162; P.L.173-2003, SEC.7 and P.L.256-2003, SEC.16.

(1) 
the funds are received as a result of damage to property of the political subdivision; and

replacing the damaged property. However, this section applies only if the funds are in fact expended to repair or replace the property within the twelve (12) month period after they are received. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) As amended by P.L.173-2003, SEC.8. 

IC 6-1.1-18-7.5 Appropriation of state and federal grant funds 
Sec. 7.5. Notwithstanding any other law, the appropriating body of a political subdivision may appropriate any funds received as a grant from the state or the federal government without using the additional appropriation procedures under section 5 of this chapter, if the funds are provided or designated by the state or the federal government as a reimbursement of an expenditure made by the political subdivision. As added by P.L.15-2005, SEC.1. 

IC 6-1.1-18-8 Expenditure of state funds by political subdivisions; conditions 
Sec. 8. (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, a political subdivision may not expend any funds which it has received from the state and which it is required to include in its budget estimate under IC 1971, 6-1.1-17-2 unless: 
(1) 
the funds have been included in a budget estimate by the political subdivision; and 

(2) 
the funds have been appropriated by the proper officers of the political subdivision in the amounts and for the specific purposes for which they may be used. 

(b) 
The county council shall appropriate funds for the operation of the county highway department for the entire ensuing budget year for which annual appropriations are being made. The appropriation

seventy-five percent (75%) of the total estimated to be in the highway fund in the ensuing budget year; or 

(2) 
ninety-nine percent (99%) of the total estimated to be in the highway fund in the ensuing budget year if the county commissioners file with the county council a four (4) year plan for the construction and improvement of county highways and a one (1) year plan for the maintenance and repair of the county highways. 


(c) In the event of a casualty, accident, or extraordinary emergency, the proper officers of a political subdivision may use state funds to make an additional appropriation under section 5 of this chapter. (Formerly: Acts 1975, P.L.47, SEC.1.) 

IC 6-1.1-18-9 Reappropriations from erroneous or excessive disbursements; refunds without appropriation 
Sec. 9. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the proper officer or officers of a political subdivision may: 
(1) reappropriate money recovered from erroneous or excessive disbursements if the error and recovery are made within the current budget year; or

(1) property tax rate or rates; or 
(2) 
special benefits tax rate or rates; referred to in the statutes listed in subsection (d).

(e) 
For property tax rates imposed for property taxes first due and payable after December 31, 2013, the new maximum rate under a statute listed in subsection (d) is the tax rate determined under STEP EIGHT of the following STEPS: 


STEP ONE: Except as provided in subsection (g), determine the maximum rate for the political subdivision levying a property tax or special benefits tax under the statute for the previous calendar year. STEP TWO: Determine the actual percentage change (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth percent (0.01%)) in the assessed value of the taxable property from the previous calendar year to 
the year in which the affected property taxes will be imposed. 
STEP THREE: Determine the three (3) calendar years that 
immediately precede the year in which the affected property 
taxes will be imposed. 
STEP FOUR: Compute separately, for each of the calendar 
years determined in STEP THREE, the actual percentage 
change (rounded to the nearest one-hundredth percent (0.01%)) 
in the assessed value (before the adjustment, if any, under 
IC 6-1.1-4-4.5) of the taxable property from the preceding year. 
STEP FIVE: Divide the sum of the three (3) quotients computed 
in STEP FOUR by three (3). 
STEP SIX: Determine the greater of the following: 

(A) Zero (0). 
(B) The STEP FIVE result. STEP SEVEN: Determine the greater of the following: 
(A) 
Zero (0). 

(B) 
The result of the STEP TWO percentage minus the 


STEP SIX percentage, if any. STEP EIGHT: Determine the quotient of the STEP ONE tax rate divided by the sum of one (1) plus the STEP SEVEN percentage, if any. 
(f) 
The department of local government finance shall compute the maximum rate allowed under subsection (e) and provide the rate to each political subdivision with authority to levy a tax under a statute listed in subsection (d). 

(g)
 This subsection applies only when calculating the maximum rate for taxes due and payable in calendar year 2013. The STEP ONE result is the greater of the following:

(h) 
This subsection applies only when calculating the maximum rate allowed under subsection (e) for the Vincennes Community School Corporation with respect to property taxes first due and payable in 2014.

(i) 
This subsection does not apply when calculating the maximum rate for the Vincennes Community School Corporation. This subsection applies only when calculating the maximum rate for a school corporation's capital projects fund for taxes due and payable in calendar year 2016.

the amount of the increase for each levy that is requested in 

the petition; or 

(2) 
the amount necessary to increase each of these levies for 2017 to the amount that each of these levies would be for 2017 if the department had used for each of these levies the maximum permissible levy instead of the certified levy when computing the township's maximum levy amount for 2004 for each of these levies.
