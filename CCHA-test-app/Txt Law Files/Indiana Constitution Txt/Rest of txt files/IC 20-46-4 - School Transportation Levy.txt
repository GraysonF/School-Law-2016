(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the levy imposed for an assessment date after January 15, 2011, may not exceed the amount determined by multiplying: 
(1) 
the school corporation's maximum permissible levy for the fund for the previous year under this chapter, after eliminating the effects of temporary excessive levy appeals and any other temporary adjustments made to the levy for the calendar year (regardless of whether the school corporation imposed the entire amount of the maximum permissible levy in the immediately preceding year); by

(c) This subsection applies to a school corporation if the school corporation's maximum permissible levy for the fund for calendar year 2009 was at least twenty-four percent (24%) less than the school corporation's maximum permissible levy for the fund for calendar year 2008. For the purposes of determining the school corporation's maximum permissible levy for the fund for calendar year 2013, the amount determined under this subsection shall be used under subsection (b)(1) as the school corporation's maximum permissible levy for the fund for the previous year. The school corporation shall be treated as having a maximum permissible levy for the fund in calendar year 2012 that is equal to the maximum permissible levy for the fund that the school corporation would have had in calendar year 2012 if:

the school corporation's maximum permissible levy is recalculated for calendar year 2009 to eliminate any loss in the school corporation's maximum permissible levy for the fund; and

the school corporation is treated as having levied the entire amount of the school corporation's recalculated maximum permissible levy for the fund in 2009, 2010, and 2011; 


as determined by the department of local government finance. The adjustment under this subsection is a permanent adjustment in the school corporation's maximum permissible levy for the fund.

Sec. 10. (a) A school corporation may appeal to the department of local government finance under IC 6-1.1-19 to increase the maximum levy permitted for the school corporation's fund. To be granted an increase by the department of local government finance, the school corporation must establish that the increase is necessary because of a transportation operating cost increase of at least ten percent (10%) over the preceding year as a result of at least one (1) of the following: 
(1) 
A fuel expense increase. 

(2) 
A significant increase in the number of students enrolled in the school corporation that need transportation or a significant increase in the mileage traveled by the school corporation's buses compared with the previous year. 

(3) 
A significant increase in the number of students enrolled in special education who need transportation or a significant increase in the mileage traveled by the school corporation's buses due to students enrolled in special education as compared with the previous year. 

(4) 
Increased transportation operating costs due to compliance with a court ordered desegregation plan. 

(5) 
The closure of a school building within the school corporation that results in a significant increase in the distances that students must be transported to attend another school building. 


In addition, before the department of local government finance may grant a maximum levy increase, the school corporation must establish that the school corporation will be unable to provide transportation services without an increase. The department of local government finance may grant a maximum operating costs levy increase that is less than the increase requested by the school corporation. 
(b) If the department of local government finance determines that a permanent increase in the maximum permissible levy is necessary, the maximum levy after the increase granted under this section becomes the school corporation's maximum permissible levy under this chapter.
