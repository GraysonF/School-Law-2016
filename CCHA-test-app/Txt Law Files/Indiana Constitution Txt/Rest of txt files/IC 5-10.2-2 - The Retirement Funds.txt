IC 5-10.2-2-1 Scope; purpose 
Sec. 1. (a) This article applies to the Indiana state teachers' retirement fund and the public employees' retirement fund. Each retirement fund covered by this article is a separate retirement fund managed by the board under the fund's retirement fund law. The board shall make and publish regulations which are appropriate to the efficient administration of this article. The obligations of the state and political subdivisions for benefit payments are specified in each retirement fund law. 
(b) The Indiana public retirement system is an independent body corporate and politic. The Indiana public retirement system is not a department or agency of the state but is an independent instrumentality exercising essential government functions. 
(c) The benefits specified in this article and the benefits from the Social Security Act provide the retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for public employees and teachers. However, this article does not prohibit a political subdivision from establishing and providing before January 1, 1995, and continuing to provide after January 1, 1995, retirement, disability, and survivor benefits for the public employees of the political subdivision independent of this article if the political subdivision took action before January 1, 1995, and was not a participant in the public employees' retirement fund on January 1, 1995, under this article or IC 5-10.3.

membership and withdraws from the fund, the amount credited to the member shall be the market value of the member's investment as of the last day of the quarter preceding the member's distribution or annuitization at retirement, disability, death, or suspension and withdrawal, plus contributions received after that date or at an alternate time established by the rules of the board.

(1) 
the normal contribution for each contribution rate group, which is the amount necessary to fund the pension portion of the retirement benefit; 

(2) 
the rate of normal contribution; 

(3) 
the unfunded accrued liability of the public employees' retirement fund, the pre-1996 account, and the 1996 account, which is the excess of total accrued liability over the fund's or account's total assets, respectively; and

(c)
 The board shall require an employer to make a supplemental contribution to the fund in addition to the amounts described in subsection (a)(3) and (a)(4) in an amount necessary to pay the employer's share of the fund's actuarial unfunded liability that other employers would otherwise be required to pay because the employer's employees are becoming members of the plan under IC 5-10.3-12 instead of the fund. The amount necessary to pay an employer's contribution under this subsection in full must be made in a lump sum or in a series of payments determined by the board.

(1) 
are subject to sections 1.5 and 11.5 of this chapter; and
