IC 6-3-2-2 "Adjusted gross income derived from sources within Indiana"; apportionment; payroll factor; sales factor; property factor; pass through entities 
Sec. 2. (a) With regard to corporations and nonresident persons, "adjusted gross income derived from sources within Indiana", for the purposes of this article, shall mean and include: 
(1) 
income from real or tangible personal property located in this state; 

(2) 
income from doing business in this state; 

(3) 
income from a trade or profession conducted in this state; 

(4) 
compensation for labor or services rendered within this state; and 

(5) 
income from stocks, bonds, notes, bank deposits, patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, good will, trademarks, trade brands, franchises, and other intangible personal property to the extent that the income is apportioned to Indiana under this section or if the income is allocated to Indiana or considered to be derived from sources within Indiana under this section. 


Income from a pass through entity shall be characterized in a manner consistent with the income's characterization for federal income tax purposes and shall be considered Indiana source income as if the person, corporation, or pass through entity that received the income had directly engaged in the income producing activity. Income that is derived from one (1) pass through entity and is considered to pass through to another pass through entity does not change these characteristics or attribution provisions. In the case of nonbusiness income described in subsection (g), only so much of such income as is allocated to this state under the provisions of subsections (h) through (k) shall be deemed to be derived from sources within Indiana. In the case of business income, only so much of such income as is apportioned to this state under the provision of subsection (b) shall be deemed to be derived from sources within the state of Indiana. In the case of compensation of a team member (as defined in section 2.7 of this chapter), only the portion of income determined to be Indiana income under section 2.7 of this chapter is considered derived from sources within Indiana. In the case of a corporation that is a life insurance company (as defined in Section 816(a) of the Internal Revenue Code) or an insurance company that is subject to tax under Section 831 of the Internal Revenue Code, only so much of the income as is apportioned to Indiana under subsection (r) is considered derived from sources within Indiana. 
(b) 
Except as provided in subsection (l), if business income of a corporation or a nonresident person is derived from sources within the state of Indiana and from sources without the state of Indiana, the business income derived from sources within this state shall be determined by multiplying the business income derived from sources both within and without the state of Indiana by the following: 

(1) 
For all taxable years that begin after December 31, 2006, and before January 1, 2008, a fraction. The: 

(A) 
numerator of the fraction is the sum of the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the product of the sales factor multiplied by three (3); and 

(B) 
denominator of the fraction is five (5). 



(2) 
For all taxable years that begin after December 31, 2007, and before January 1, 2009, a fraction. The: 

(A) 
numerator of the fraction is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the product of the sales factor multiplied by four and sixty-seven hundredths (4.67); and 

(B) 
denominator of the fraction is six and sixty-seven hundredths (6.67). 



(3) 
For all taxable years beginning after December 31, 2008, and before January 1, 2010, a fraction. The: 

(A) 
numerator of the fraction is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the product of the sales factor multiplied by eight (8); and 

(B) 
denominator of the fraction is ten (10). 



(4) 
For all taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, a fraction. The: 

(A) 
numerator of the fraction is the property factor plus the payroll factor plus the product of the sales factor multiplied by eighteen (18); and 

(B) 
denominator of the fraction is twenty (20). 



(5) 
For all taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010, the sales factor. 



(c) 
The property factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this state during the taxable year and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the taxable year. However, with respect to a foreign corporation, the denominator does not include the average value of real or tangible personal property owned or rented and used in a place that is outside the United States. Property owned by the taxpayer is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the taxpayer is valued at eight (8) times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the taxpayer less any annual rental rate received by the taxpayer from subrentals. The average of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the taxable year, but the department may require the averaging of monthly values during the taxable year if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the taxpayer's property. 

(d) 
The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this state during the taxable year by the taxpayer for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid everywhere during the taxable year. However, with respect to a foreign corporation, the denominator does not include compensation paid in a place that is outside the United States. Compensation is paid in this state if: 

(1) 
the individual's service is performed entirely within the state; 

(2) 
the individual's service is performed both within and without this state, but the service performed without this state is 

incidental to the individual's service within this state; or 

(3) 
some of the service is performed in this state and: 

(A) 
the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in this state; or 

(B) 
the base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any state in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual is a resident of this state. 





(e) 
The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this state during the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the taxable year. Sales include receipts from intangible property and receipts from the sale or exchange of intangible property. However, with respect to a foreign corporation, the denominator does not include sales made in a place that is outside the United States. Receipts from intangible personal property are derived from sources within Indiana if the receipts from the intangible personal property are attributable to Indiana under section 2.2 of this chapter. Regardless of the f.o.b. point or other conditions of the sale, sales of tangible personal property are in this state if: 

(1) 
the property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser that is within Indiana, other than the United States government; or 

(2) 
the property is shipped from an office, a store, a warehouse, a factory, or other place of storage in this state and the purchaser is the United States government. 




Gross receipts derived from commercial printing as described in IC 6-2.5-1-10 and from the sale of computer software shall be treated as sales of tangible personal property for purposes of this chapter. 
(f) 
Sales, other than receipts from intangible property covered by subsection (e) and sales of tangible personal property, are in this state if: 

(1) 
the income-producing activity is performed in this state; or 

(2) 
the income-producing activity is performed both within and without this state and a greater proportion of the income-producing activity is performed in this state than in any other state, based on costs of performance. 



(g) 
Rents and royalties from real or tangible personal property, capital gains, interest, dividends, or patent or copyright royalties, to the extent that they constitute nonbusiness income, shall be allocated as provided in subsections (h) through (k). 

(h)(1) Net rents and royalties from real property located in this state are allocable to this state. 

(2) 
Net rents and royalties from tangible personal property are allocated to this state: 

(i)
 if and to the extent that the property is utilized in this state; or 

(ii) 
in their entirety if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not organized under the laws of or taxable in the state in which the property is utilized. 



(3) 
The extent of utilization of tangible personal property in a state is determined by multiplying the rents and royalties by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property in the state during the rental or royalty period in the taxable year, and the denominator of which is the number of days of physical location of the property everywhere during all rental or royalty periods in the taxable year. If the physical location of the property during the rental or royalty period is unknown or unascertainable by the taxpayer, tangible personal property is utilized in the state in which the property was located at the time the rental or royalty payer obtained possession. 

(i)(1) Capital gains and losses from sales of real property located in this state are allocable to this state. 

(2) 
Capital gains and losses from sales of tangible personal property are allocable to this state if: 

(i) 
the property had a situs in this state at the time of the sale; or 

(ii) 
the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state and the taxpayer is not taxable in the state in which the property had a situs. 



(3) 
Capital gains and losses from sales of intangible personal property are allocable to this state if the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state. 


(j) Interest and dividends are allocable to this state if the 
taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state. (k)(1) Patent and copyright royalties are allocable to this state: 
(i) 
if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the taxpayer in this state; or 

(ii) 
if and to the extent that the patent or copyright is utilized by the taxpayer in a state in which the taxpayer is not taxable and the taxpayer's commercial domicile is in this state. 

(2) 
A patent is utilized in a state to the extent that it is employed in production, fabrication, manufacturing, or other processing in the state or to the extent that a patented product is produced in the state. If the basis of receipts from patent royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the patent is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located. 

(3) 
A copyright is utilized in a state to the extent that printing or other publication originates in the state. If the basis of receipts from copyright royalties does not permit allocation to states or if the accounting procedures do not reflect states of utilization, the copyright is utilized in the state in which the taxpayer's commercial domicile is located. 


(l) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this article do not fairly represent the taxpayer's income derived from sources within the state of Indiana, the taxpayer may petition for or the department may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business activity, if reasonable: 
(1) 
separate accounting; 

(2) 
for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 2011, the exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors, except the sales factor; 

(3) 
the inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer's income derived from sources within the state of Indiana; or 

(4) 
the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer's income. 


(m) 
In the case of two (2) or more organizations, trades, or businesses owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests, the department shall distribute, apportion, or allocate the income derived from sources within the state of Indiana between and among those organizations, trades, or businesses in order to fairly reflect and report the income derived from sources within the state of Indiana by various taxpayers. 

(n) 
For purposes of allocation and apportionment of income under this article, a taxpayer is taxable in another state if: 

(1) 
in that state the taxpayer is subject to a net income tax, a franchise tax measured by net income, a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business, or a corporate stock tax; or 

(2) 
that state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not. 



(o) 
Notwithstanding subsections (l) and (m), the department may not, under any circumstances, require that income, deductions, and credits attributable to a taxpayer and another entity be reported in a combined income tax return for any taxable year, if the other entity is: 

(1) 
a foreign corporation; or 

(2) 
a corporation that is classified as a foreign operating corporation for the taxable year by section 2.4 of this chapter. 



(p) 
Notwithstanding subsections (l) and (m), the department may not require that income, deductions, and credits attributable to a taxpayer and another entity not described in subsection (o)(1) or (o)(2) be reported in a combined income tax return for any taxable year, unless the department is unable to fairly reflect the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year through use of other powers granted to the department by subsections (l) and (m). 

(q) 
Notwithstanding subsections (o) and (p), one (1) or more taxpayers may petition the department under subsection (l) for permission to file a combined income tax return for a taxable year. 

The petition to file a combined income tax return must be completed and filed with the department not more than thirty (30) days after the end of the taxpayer's taxable year. A taxpayer filing a combined income tax return must petition the department within thirty (30) days after the end of the taxpayer's taxable year to discontinue filing a combined income tax return. 

(r) 
This subsection applies to a corporation that is a life insurance company (as defined in Section 816(a) of the Internal Revenue Code) or an insurance company that is subject to tax under Section 831 of the Internal Revenue Code. The corporation's adjusted gross income that is derived from sources within Indiana is determined by multiplying the corporation's adjusted gross income by a fraction: 

(1) 
the numerator of which is the direct premiums and annuity considerations received during the taxable year for insurance upon property or risks in the state; and 

(2) 
the denominator of which is the direct premiums and annuity considerations received during the taxable year for insurance upon property or risks everywhere. 




The term "direct premiums and annuity considerations" means the gross premiums received from direct business as reported in the corporation's annual statement filed with the department of insurance. 
(s) This subsection applies to receipts derived from motorsports racing. 
(1) 
Any purse, prize money, or other amounts earned for placement or participation in a race or portion thereof, including qualification, shall be attributed to Indiana if the race is conducted in Indiana. 

(2) 
Any amounts received from an individual or entity as a result of sponsorship or similar promotional consideration for one (1) or more races shall be in this state in the amount received, multiplied by the following fraction: 

(A) 
The numerator of the fraction is the number of racing events for which sponsorship or similar promotional consideration has been paid in a taxable year and that occur in Indiana. 

(B) 
The denominator of the fraction is the total number of racing events for which sponsorship or similar promotional consideration has been paid in a taxable year. 



(3)

IC 6-3-2-2.4 Foreign operating corporations; determination of percentage of business activity outside United States 
Sec. 2.4. (a) For purposes of section 2(o) of this chapter, a corporation is a foreign operating corporation for a particular taxable year if it has eighty percent (80%) or more of its total business activity occurring outside the United States during the taxable year. 
(b) For purposes of determining the amount of a corporation's business activity that occurs within the United States, the department shall determine the sum of that corporation's United States property factor and its United States payroll factor and divide that sum by two (2). If the quotient exceeds two-tenths (0.2), then less than eighty percent (80%) of the corporation's business shall be considered to have occurred outside the United States. If the quotient equals or is less than two-tenths (0.2), then eighty percent (80%) or more of the corporation's business shall be considered to have occurred outside the United States. If a corporation's United States property factor or its United States payroll factor has a denominator of zero (0), then the sum of the two (2) factors shall be divided by one (1) and not by two (2). 
(c) The United States property factor of a corporation is a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the average value of the corporation's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in the United States during the taxable year, and the denominator of the fraction is the average value of all the corporation's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used anywhere in the world during the taxable year. Property owned by the corporation shall be valued at its original cost. Property rented by the corporation shall be valued at eight (8) times the net annual rental rate. The corporation's net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the corporation less any annual rental rate received by the corporation from subrentals. The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the taxable year, but the department may require the averaging of monthly values during the taxable year if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the corporation's property. 
(d) The United States payroll factor of a corporation is a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the total compensation to individuals paid in the United States during the taxable year by the corporation, and the denominator of the fraction is the total compensation to individuals paid anywhere in the world during the taxable year by the corporation. Compensation to an individual is paid in the United States if: 
(1) 
the individual's service is performed entirely within the United States; 

(2) 
the individual's service is performed both within and outside the United States, but the service performed outside the United States is incidental to the individual's service within the United States; or 

(3) 
the individual is a resident of the United States, some of the service is performed in the United States, and: 

(A) 
the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the United States; or 

(B) 
the base of operations or, if there is no base of operations, the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in a jurisdiction that is outside the United States and that is where some part of the service is performed.

Sec. 2.7. (a) As used in this section: 
(1)

a bonus earned as a result of play during the season, such as a performance bonus, including a bonus paid for a championship, playoff, or bowl game played by a team, or for selection to an all-star league or other honorary position; and 

(B) 
a bonus paid for signing a contract, unless all of the following conditions are met: 

(i) 
The payment of the signing bonus is not conditional upon the signee playing any games for the team, performing any subsequent services for the team, or making the team. 

(ii) 
The signing bonus is payable separately from the salary and any other compensation. 




(iii) The signing bonus is nonrefundable.

(A) 
travel days spent in Indiana that do not involve either a game, practice, team meeting, promotional caravan, or other similar team event; and 

(B) 
those days spent in Indiana for which a team member is on the disabled list. 



(3) 
"Team" includes a professional baseball, basketball, football, hockey, or soccer team that played games in Indiana or that had services rendered in Indiana by a team member. 

(4) 
"Team member" includes employees who are active players, players on the disabled list, and any other individuals required to travel and who do travel with and perform services on behalf of a team on a regular basis. The term includes coaches, managers, and trainers. 

(5) 
"Total duty days" means all days during the taxable year that a team member renders a service for the team, beginning with the team's official preseason training period through the last game in which the team competes or is scheduled to compete. The term includes days on which a team member renders a service for the team on a date that does not fall within this period. The term includes: 

(A) 
game days, practice days, days spent at team meetings, days spent with a promotional caravan and at preseason training camps, and days served with the team through all postseason games in which the team competes or is scheduled to compete; 

(B) 
days spent conducting training and rehabilitation activities, but only if the service is conducted at the facilities of the team; 

(C) 
travel days that do not involve either a game, practice, team meeting, promotional caravan, or other similar team event; 

(D) 
days spent participating in instructional leagues and all-star or pro bowl games; and 



(E) 
days for which a team member is on the disabled list. Total duty days for an individual who joins a team during the season begin on the day the individual joins the team, and, for an individual who leaves a team, end on the day the individual leaves the team. When an individual changes teams during a taxable year, a separate duty day calculation must be made for the period the individual was with each team. Total duty days do not include those days for which a team member is not compensated and is not rendering a service for the team in any manner, including days when the team member has been suspended without pay and prohibited from performing any 

services for the team. 

(6) 
"Total income" means the total compensation received during the taxable year for services rendered: 

(A) 
from the beginning of the official preseason training period through the last game in which the team competes or is scheduled to compete during that taxable year; and 

(B) 
on a date during the taxable year that does not fall within the period described in clause (A), such as participation in instructional leagues, an all-star or pro bowl game, or with a promotional caravan. 




The term includes salaries, wages, bonuses, and any other type of compensation paid during the taxable year to a team member for services rendered in that year. The term does not include strike benefits, severance pay, termination pay, contract or option year buy-out payments, expansion or relocation payments, or any other payments not related to services rendered to the team. 
(b) 
For purposes of IC 6-3, Indiana income is the individual's total income during the taxable year multiplied by the following fraction: 

(1) 
The numerator of the fraction is the individual's Indiana duty days for the taxable year. 

(2) 
The denominator of the fraction is the individual's total duty days for the taxable year. 



(c) 
It is presumed that this section results in a fair and equitable apportionment of the team member's compensation. However, if the department demonstrates that the method provided under this section does not fairly and equitably apportion a team member's compensation, the department may require the team member to apportion the team member's compensation under another method that the department prescribes. The prescribed method must result in a fair and equitable apportionment. A team member may submit a proposal for an alternative method to apportion the team member's compensation if the team member demonstrates that the method provided under this section does not fairly and equitably apportion the team member's compensation. If approved by the department, the proposed method must be fully explained in the team member's nonresident personal income tax return. 

(d) 
The department may adopt rules under IC 4-22-2 to establish either of the following methods of simplifying return filing for team members of a team, if the team is not based in Indiana: 

(1) 
A withholding system requiring a team to withhold adjusted gross income tax for each team member and to remit the withheld taxes to Indiana on an annual basis. The department may require each team to submit information for each team member regarding total income, Indiana income subject to tax under this section, and the amount of tax withheld. Remittance of the withholding and submission of the required information satisfies the team member's tax liability and return filing 

responsibilities under this article. A team that is required to withhold and remit shall provide all participating team members with a Form W-2 evidencing the amount of tax withheld and remitted to Indiana. Even though a team is required to withhold and remit, a team member may file an individual income tax return to claim a refund if the amount remitted exceeds the amount otherwise owed using the methodology under this section. However, if the team member files an individual income tax return to claim such a refund, the team member is required to notify the team member's state of residence of the filing. 

(2) 
A composite return method that permits the filing of a composite tax return by the team on behalf of each team member. Other department rules concerning composite returns apply to the extent these rules are not inconsistent with this subsection. The team must obtain approval from the department before filing a composite return. The team must obtain written authorization each taxable year from each team member who elects to participate in the composite return. The participating team members must acknowledge through their elections that the composite return constitutes an irrevocable filing and that they may not file an individual income tax return in Indiana. The team must maintain a power of attorney from each participating team member that authorizes the team to represent them in a protest or other appeal. The team and participating team members must agree that the team is responsible for any deficiencies, including penalties. The team shall withhold tax from each participating team member's compensation and remit it to the state of Indiana. The return must contain information for each participating team member regarding total income, Indiana income subject to tax using the methodology under this section, and the amount of tax due. Filing of the return and remittance of the tax satisfy the participating team member's tax liability and return filing responsibilities under IC 6-3-4-1. 




If the method under subdivision (1) or the method under subdivision 
(2) is required, a team member's Indiana adjusted gross income may not be reduced by using a deduction, an exemption, or an exclusion. For a team member to participate in either method, a team member's compensation from the team must be the only source of income attributable to Indiana. If a team member leaves the team during a taxable year, the team remains responsible for remitting the appropriate tax and may either collect the tax paid from the team member or absorb the cost itself.

(2) 
for a race team not based in Indiana to file a composite return on behalf of and covering more than one (1) race team member if the same amount of tax is remitted as if individual filings had occurred. Filing a composite return under this subdivision exempts:
