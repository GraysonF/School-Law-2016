IC 20-26-11 
Chapter 11. Legal Settlement and Transfer of Students; Transfer Tuition 
IC 20-26-11-0.2 Application of certain amendments to prior law 
Sec. 0.2. The amendments made to IC 20-8.1-6.1-9 (before its repeal, now codified at section 14 of this chapter) by P.L.260-1997 apply only to school years beginning after June 30, 1996. As added by P.L.220-2011, SEC.330. 

IC 20-26-11-1 "Residence", "resides", and comparable terms 
Sec. 1. As used in this chapter with respect to legal settlement, transfers, and the payment of tuition, the words "residence", "resides", or other comparable language means a permanent and principal habitation that an individual uses for a home for a fixed or indefinite period, at which the individual remains when not called elsewhere for work, studies, recreation, or other temporary or special purpose. These terms are not synonymous with legal domicile. Except as provided in section 2(3) of this chapter, where a court order grants an individual custody of a student, the residence of the student is where that individual resides. As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.10. Amended by P.L.13-2006, SEC.1. 

IC 20-26-11-2 Legal settlement 
Sec. 2. The legal settlement of a student is governed by the following provisions: 
(1) If the student: 
(A) 
is less than eighteen (18) years of age; or 

(B) 
is at least eighteen (18) years of age but is not 


emancipated; the legal settlement of the student is in the attendance area of the school corporation where the student's parents reside. 
(2) If the student's mother and father, in a situation to which subdivision (1) otherwise applies, are divorced or separated, the legal settlement of the student is the school corporation whose attendance area contains the residence of the parent with whom the student is living, in the following situations: 
(A) 
If a court order has not been made establishing the custody of the student. 

(B) 
Except as provided in subdivision (3), if both parents have agreed on the parent or person with whom the student will live. 

(C) 
If the parent granted custody of the student has 


abandoned the student. In the event of a dispute between the parents of the student, or between the parents and a student at least eighteen (18) years of age, the legal settlement of the student shall be determined as otherwise provided in this section. 
(3) 
If, in a situation in which subdivision (1) otherwise applies, the student's mother and father are divorced or separated, and if a court order grants the student's: 

(A) 
mother; 

(B) 
father; or 



(C) 
both mother and father; custody of the student, the legal settlement of the student is the school corporation whose attendance area contains the residence of the mother or father, as elected under section 2.5(a) of this chapter. If the custodial parent (or the student, if at least eighteen (18) years of age) does not make an election under section 2.5(a) of this chapter, the legal settlement of the student is the school corporation whose attendance area contains the residence of the parent granted physical custody by the court order. 

(4) 
If the legal settlement of a student, in a situation to which subdivision (1) otherwise applies, cannot reasonably be determined and the student is being supported by, cared for by, and living with some other individual, the legal settlement of the student is in the attendance area of that individual's residence, except where the parents of the student are able to support the student but have placed the student in the home of another individual, or allowed the student to live with another individual, primarily for the purpose of attending school in the attendance area where the other individual resides. The school may, if the facts are in dispute, condition acceptance of the student's legal settlement on the appointment of that individual as legal guardian or custodian of the student, and the date of legal settlement will be fixed to coincide with the commencement of the proceedings for the appointment of a guardian or custodian. However, if a student does not reside with the student's parents because the student's parents are unable to support the child and the child is not residing with an individual other than a parent primarily to attend a particular school, the student's legal settlement is where the student resides, and the establishment of a legal guardianship may not be required by the school. In addition, a legal guardianship or custodianship established solely to attend school in a particular school corporation does not affect the determination of the legal settlement of the student under this chapter. 

(5) 
If a student, to whom subdivision (1) would otherwise apply, is married and living with a spouse, the legal settlement of that student is in the attendance area of the school corporation where the student and the student's spouse reside. 

(6) 
If the student's parents: 


(A) 
are living outside the United States due to educational pursuits or a job assignment; 

(B) 
do not maintain a permanent home in any school corporation in the United States; and 

(C) 
have placed the student in the home of another 


individual; the legal settlement of the student is in the attendance area where the other individual resides. 
(7) 
If the student is emancipated, the legal settlement is the attendance area of the school corporation of the student's residence. 

(8) 
If a student's legal settlement is changed after the student has begun attending school in a school corporation in any school year, the effective date of change may: 


(A) at the election of: 
(i)
 the parent; 

(ii) 
the student, if the student is at least eighteen (18) years of age; or 


(iii) a juvenile court conducting a proceeding under IC 31-34-20-5, IC 31-34-21-10, IC 31-37-19-26, or IC 31-37-20-6 (or IC 31-6-4-18.5 before its repeal); 
be extended until the end of that semester; or 
(B) at the discretion of the school, until the end of that 
school year. However, that election, where a student has completed grade 11 in any school year, shall extend to the end of the following school year in grade 12. 
(9) 
If a juvenile court has: 

(A) made findings of fact concerning the legal settlement of a student under IC 31-34-20-5, IC 31-34-21-10, IC 31-37-19-26, or IC 31-37-20-6 (or IC 31-6-4-18.5 before its repeal); and 

(B) 
jurisdiction over the student under IC 31-34 or IC 31-37; the legal settlement of the student is the attendance area specified as the legal settlement in the latest findings of fact issued by the juvenile court.

IC 20-26-11-2.5 Election to have legal settlement 
Sec. 2.5. (a) In the case of a student described in section 2(3) of this chapter, the: 
(1) parent granted physical custody by a court; or 
(2) 
student, if the student is at least eighteen (18) years of age; may elect for the student to have legal settlement in the school corporation whose attendance area contains the residence of the student's mother or the school corporation whose attendance area contains the residence of the student's father. 

(b) 
An election under subsection (a) shall be made on a yearly basis and applies throughout the school year unless the student's parent no longer resides within the attendance area of the school corporation. 

(c) The parent or student who makes an election under subsection 

(a)
 is not required to pay transfer tuition.

The state superintendent shall prepare the form of agreement to be used under section 2(2) of this chapter and a form to be executed by any individual with whom the student is living under section 2(2), 2(3), 2(4), or 2(6) of this chapter. The execution of the form by the individual and its continuance in force is a condition to the application of section 2(2), 2(3), 2(4), or 2(6) of this chapter. The form must contain an agreement of the individual that the individual shall, with respect to dealing with the school corporation and for all other purposes under this article, assume all the duties and be subject to all the liabilities of a parent of the student in the same manner as if the individual were the student's parent. On the execution of that form and for as long as it remains in force, the individual has these duties and liabilities. As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.10. Amended by P.L.13-2006, SEC.4.

furnishes the student's support from the student's own resources; 

(2) 
is not dependent in any material way on the student's parents for support; 

(3) 
files or is required by applicable law to file a separate tax return; and

Sec. 5. (a) The parents of any student, regardless of the student's age, or the student after the student has become eighteen (18) years of age may request a transfer from a school corporation in which the student has a legal settlement to a transferee school corporation in Indiana or another state if the student may be better accommodated in the public schools of the transferee corporation. Whether the student can be better accommodated depends on such matters as: 
(1) 
crowded conditions of the transferee or transferor corporation; and 

(2) 
curriculum offerings at the high school level that are important to the vocational or academic aspirations of the student. 


(b) The request for transfer must be made in writing to the transferor corporation, which shall immediately mail a copy to the transferee corporation. The request for transfer must be made at the times provided under rules adopted by the state board. The transfer is effected if both the transferee and the transferor corporations approve the transfer not more than thirty (30) days after that mailing. If the transferor school corporation fails to act on the transfer request within thirty (30) days after the request is received, the transfer is considered approved. The transfer is denied when either school corporation: mails a written denial by certified mail to the requesting parents or student at their last known address. 
(c) If a request for transfer is denied under subsection (b), an appeal may be taken to the state board by the requesting parents or student, if commenced not more than ten (10) days after the denial. An appeal is commenced by mailing a notice of appeal by certified mail to the superintendent of each school corporation and the state board. The state superintendent shall develop forms for this purpose, and the transferor corporation shall assist the parents or student in the mechanics of commencing the appeal. An appeal hearing must comply with section 15 of this chapter. As added by P.L.1-2005, SEC.10. Amended by P.L.89-2005, SEC.3. 

IC 20-26-11-6 Transfer tuition 
Sec. 6. (a) A school corporation may accept a transferring student without approval of the transferor corporation under section 5 of this chapter.

A transfer may be accepted regardless of whether, as a condition of the transfer, the transferee school requires the requesting parents or student to pay transfer tuition in an amount determined under the formula established in section 13 of this chapter for the payment of transfer tuition by a transferor school corporation. However, if the transferee school elects to charge transfer tuition, the transferee school may not offset the amounts described in section 13(b) STEP TWO (B) through section 13(b) STEP TWO (D) of this chapter from the amount charged to the requesting parents or student. 

(c) 
When the transferee school elects to charge tuition to the requesting parents or student, the tuition determined under subsection (b) must be paid by the parents or the student before the end of the school year in installments as determined by the transferee corporation. 

(d) 
Failure to pay a tuition installment that is agreed to by the parents or student and the transferee school corporation is a ground 

for exclusion from school. 

(e) 
If the transferee school elects not to charge transfer tuition to the parents or student under this section, the transferee school may not charge transfer tuition or fees to the transferor school.

IC 20-26-11-13 Version a Determination of transfer tuition 
Note: This version of section effective until 1-1-2017. See also following version of this section, effective 1-1-2017. 
Sec. 13. (a) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings: 
(1) 
"Class of school" refers to a classification of each school or program in the transferee corporation by the grades or special programs taught at the school. Generally, these classifications are denominated as kindergarten, elementary school, middle 

school or junior high school, high school, and special schools or classes, such as schools or classes for special education, career and technical education, or career education. 

(2) 
"Special equipment" means equipment that during a school year: 

(A) 
is used only when a child with disabilities is attending school; 

(B) 
is not used to transport a child to or from a place where the child is attending school; 

(C) 
is necessary for the education of each child with disabilities that uses the equipment, as determined under the individualized education program for the child; and 

(D) 
is not used for or by any child who is not a child with disabilities. 



(3) 
"Student enrollment" means the following: 

(A) 
The total number of students in kindergarten through grade 12 who are enrolled in a transferee school corporation on a date determined by the state board. 

(B) 
The total number of students enrolled in a class of school in a transferee school corporation on a date determined by the state board. 




However, a kindergarten student shall be counted under clauses 
(A) and (B) as one-half (1/2) student. The state board may select a different date for counts under this subdivision. However, the same date shall be used for all school corporations making a count for the same class of school. 
(b) Each transferee corporation is entitled to receive for each school year on account of each transferred student, except a student transferred under section 6 of this chapter, transfer tuition from the transferor corporation or the state as provided in this chapter. Transfer tuition equals the amount determined under STEP THREE of the following formula: 
STEP ONE: Allocate to each transfer student the capital expenditures for any special equipment used by the transfer student and a proportionate share of the operating costs incurred by the transferee school for the class of school where the transfer student is enrolled. STEP TWO: If the transferee school included the transfer student in the transferee school's current ADM, allocate to the transfer student a proportionate share of the following general fund revenues of the transferee school: 
(A) 
State tuition support distributions received during the calendar year in which the school year ends. 

(B) 
Property tax levies under IC 20-45-7 and IC 20-45-8 for the calendar year in which the school year ends. 

(C) 
The sum of the following excise tax revenue received for deposit in the calendar year in which the school year begins: 

(i)
 Financial institution excise tax revenue (IC 6-5.5). 

(ii) 
Motor vehicle excise taxes (IC 6-6-5). 




(iii) Commercial vehicle excise taxes (IC 6-6-5.5). 
(iv)
 Boat excise tax (IC 6-6-11). 

(v)
 Aircraft license excise tax (IC 6-6-6.5). 


(D) Allocations to the transferee school under IC 6-3.5. STEP THREE: Determine the greater of: 
(A) 
zero (0); or 

(B) 
the result of subtracting the STEP TWO amount from 


the STEP ONE amount. If a child is placed in an institution or facility in Indiana by or with the approval of the department of child services, the institution or facility shall charge the department of child services for the use of the space within the institution or facility (commonly called capital costs) that is used to provide educational services to the child based upon a prorated per student cost. 
(c) Operating costs shall be determined for each class of school where a transfer student is enrolled. The operating cost for each class of school is based on the total expenditures of the transferee corporation for the class of school from its general fund expenditures as specified in the classified budget forms prescribed by the state board of accounts. This calculation excludes: 
(1) 
capital outlay; 

(2) 
debt service; 

(3) 
costs of transportation; 

(4) 
salaries of board members; 

(5) 
contracted service for legal expenses; and 

(6) 
any expenditure that is made from extracurricular account 


receipts; for the school year. 
(d) 
The capital cost of special equipment for a school year is equal to: 

(1) 
the cost of the special equipment; divided by 

(2) 
the product of: 

(A) 
the useful life of the special equipment, as determined under the rules adopted by the state board; multiplied by 

(B) 
the number of students using the special equipment during at least part of the school year. 





(e) 
When an item of expense or cost described in subsection (c) cannot be allocated to a class of school, it shall be prorated to all classes of schools on the basis of the student enrollment of each class in the transferee corporation compared with the total student enrollment in the school corporation. 

(f) 
Operating costs shall be allocated to a transfer student for each school year by dividing: 

(1) 
the transferee school corporation's operating costs for the class of school in which the transfer student is enrolled; by 

(2) 
the student enrollment of the class of school in which the transfer student is enrolled. 




When a transferred student is enrolled in a transferee corporation for less than the full school year of student attendance, the transfer tuition shall be calculated by the part of the school year for which the transferred student is enrolled. A school year of student attendance consists of the number of days school is in session for student attendance. A student, regardless of the student's attendance, is enrolled in a transferee school unless the student is no longer entitled to be transferred because of a change of residence, the student has been excluded or expelled from school for the balance of the school year or for an indefinite period, or the student has been confirmed to have withdrawn from school. The transferor and the transferee corporation may enter into written agreements concerning the amount of transfer tuition due in any school year. If an agreement cannot be reached, the amount shall be determined by the state board, and costs may be established, when in dispute, by the state board of accounts. 
(g) A transferee school shall allocate revenues described in subsection (b) STEP TWO to a transfer student by dividing: 
(1) 
the total amount of revenues received during a period; by 

(2) 
the current ADM of the transferee school for the period in 


which the revenues are received. However, for state tuition support distributions or any other state distribution computed using less than the total current ADM of the transferee school, the transferee school shall allocate the revenues to the transfer student by dividing the revenues that the transferee school is eligible to receive during the period by the student count used to compute the state distribution. 
(h) 
Instead of the payments provided in subsection (b), the transferor corporation or state owing transfer tuition may enter into a long term contract with the transferee corporation governing the transfer of students. The contract may: 

(1) 
be entered into for a period of not more than five (5) years with an option to renew; 

(2) 
specify a maximum number of students to be transferred; and 

(3) 
fix a method for determining the amount of transfer tuition and the time of payment, which may be different from that provided in section 14 of this chapter. 



(i) 
A school corporation may negotiate transfer tuition agreements with a neighboring school corporation that can accommodate additional students. Agreements under this section may: 

(1) 
be for one (1) year or longer; and 

(2) 
fix a method for determining the amount of transfer tuition or time of payment that is different from the method, amount, or time of payment that is provided in this section or section 14 of this chapter. 




A school corporation may not transfer a student under this section without the prior approval of the child's parent.

contracted service for legal expenses; and 

(6) 
any expenditure that is made from extracurricular account 


receipts; for the school year. 
(d) 
The capital cost of special equipment for a school year is equal to: 

(1) 
the cost of the special equipment; divided by 

(2) 
the product of: 

(A) 
the useful life of the special equipment, as determined

Sec. 22. (a) The transferee corporation is entitled to receive from the transferor corporation transfer tuition for each transferred student for each school year calculated in two (2) parts as follows: 
(1) Operating cost. 
(2) 
Capital cost. These costs must be allocated on a per student basis separately for each class of school. 

(b) 
The operating cost for each class of school must be based on the total expenditures of the transferee corporation for the class from its general fund expenditures as set out on the classified budget forms prescribed by the state board of accounts, excluding from the calculation capital outlay, debt service, costs of transportation, salaries of board members, contracted service for legal expenses, and any expenditure that is made out of the general fund from extracurricular account receipts, for the school year. 

(c) 
The capital cost for each class of school must consist of the lesser of the following alternatives: 


(1) The capital cost must be based on an amount equal to five percent (5%) of the cost of transferee corporation's physical plant, equipment, and all items connected to the physical plant or equipment, including: 
(A) 
buildings, additions, and remodeling to the buildings, 

excluding ordinary maintenance; and 

(B)

waterlines, drives, and playgrounds; that have been paid or are obligated to be paid in the future out of the general fund, capital projects fund, or debt service fund, including principal and interest, lease rental payments, and funds that were legal predecessors to these funds. If an item of the physical plant, equipment, appurtenances, or part of the item is more than twenty (20) years old at the beginning of the school year, the capital cost of the item shall be disregarded in making the capital cost computation. 
(2) The capital cost must be based on the amount budgeted from the general fund for capital outlay for physical plant, equipment, and appurtenances and the amounts levied for the debt service fund and the capital projects fund for the calendar year in which the school year ends. 
(d) 
If an item of expense or cost cannot be allocated to a class of school, the item shall be prorated to all classes of schools on the basis of the ADM of each class in the transferee corporation, as determined in the fall count of ADM in the school year, compared to the total current ADM therein, as determined in the fall count of ADM in the school year.
