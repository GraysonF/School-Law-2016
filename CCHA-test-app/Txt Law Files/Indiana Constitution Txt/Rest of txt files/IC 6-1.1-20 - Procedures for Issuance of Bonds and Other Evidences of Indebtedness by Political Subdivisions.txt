(10) 
business days after receiving the statement from the county auditor under subdivision (5) make the final determination of: 

(A) 
the number of registered voters in the political subdivision that signed a petition and, based on the statement provided by the county auditor, the number of owners of property within the political subdivision that signed a petition; and 

(B) 
the number of registered voters in the political subdivision that signed a remonstrance and, based on the statement provided by the county auditor, the number of owners of property within the political subdivision that signed a remonstrance. 




Whenever the name of an individual who signs a petition or remonstrance as a registered voter contains a minor variation from the name of the registered voter as set forth in the records of the county voter registration office, the signature is presumed to be valid, and there is a presumption that the individual is entitled to sign the petition or remonstrance under this section. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, in determining whether an individual is a registered voter, the county voter registration office shall apply the requirements and procedures used under IC 3 to determine whether a person is a registered voter for purposes of voting in an election governed by IC 3. However, an individual is not required to comply with the provisions concerning providing proof of identification to be considered a registered voter for purposes of this chapter. A person is entitled to sign a petition or remonstrance only one (1) time in a particular petition and remonstrance process under this chapter, regardless of whether the person owns more than one 
(1) 
parcel of real property, mobile home assessed as personal property, or manufactured home assessed as personal property or a combination of those types of property within the subdivision and regardless of whether the person is both a registered voter in the political subdivision and the owner of property within the political subdivision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a petition or remonstrance is presented to the county voter registration office within forty-five (45) days before an election, the county voter registration office may defer acting on the petition or remonstrance, and the time requirements under this section for action by the county voter registration office do not begin to run until five (5) days after the date of the election. 

(7) 
The county voter registration office must file a certificate and the petition or remonstrance with the body of the political subdivision charged with issuing bonds or entering into leases within thirty-five (35) business days of the filing of a petition or remonstrance under subdivision (4), whichever applies, containing ten thousand (10,000) signatures or less. The county 

voter registration office may take an additional five (5) days to review and certify the petition or remonstrance for each additional five thousand (5,000) signatures up to a maximum of sixty (60) days. The certificate must state the number of petitioners and remonstrators that are owners of property within the political subdivision and the number of petitioners who are registered voters residing within the political subdivision. 

(8) 
If a greater number of persons who are either owners of property within the political subdivision or registered voters residing within the political subdivision sign a remonstrance than the number that signed a petition, the bonds petitioned for may not be issued or the lease petitioned for may not be entered into. The proper officers of the political subdivision may not make a preliminary determination to issue bonds or enter into a lease for the controlled project defeated by the petition and remonstrance process under this section or any other controlled project that is not substantially different within one (1) year after the date of the county voter registration office's certificate under subdivision (7). Withdrawal of a petition carries the same consequences as a defeat of the petition. 

(9) 
After a political subdivision has gone through the petition and remonstrance process set forth in this section, the political subdivision is not required to follow any other remonstrance or objection procedures under any other law (including section 5 of this chapter) relating to bonds or leases designed to protect owners of property within the political subdivision from the imposition of property taxes to pay debt service or lease rentals. However, the political subdivision must still receive the approval of the department of local government finance if required by: 

(A) 
IC 6-1.1-18.5-8; or 

(B) 
IC 20-46-7-8, IC 20-46-7-9, and IC 20-46-7-10.

IC 6-1.1-20-3.3 Applicability of other statutes to imposition of property taxes 
Sec. 3.3. Notwithstanding any other law, a political subdivision may issue or enter into obligations under any statute that requires or permits the imposition of property taxes to pay debt service or lease rentals without pledging to impose property taxes, if necessary, to pay the debt service or lease rentals. If the proper officers of a political subdivision determine to use revenues other than property taxes to pay obligations without pledging to impose property taxes for that purpose, provisions of any other statute relating to controlling property taxes do not apply to the issuance of or entering into the obligations.

After notice is given, a petition requesting the application of the local public question process under section 3.6 of this chapter may be filed by the lesser of: 

(A) 
five hundred (500) persons who are either owners of property within the political subdivision or registered voters residing within the political subdivision; or 

(B)

(5) 
The state board of accounts shall design and, upon request by the county voter registration office, deliver to the county voter registration office or the county voter registration office's designated printer the petition forms to be used solely in the petition process described in this section. The county voter registration office shall issue to an owner or owners of property within the political subdivision or a registered voter residing within the political subdivision the number of petition forms requested by the owner or owners or the registered voter. Each form must be accompanied by instructions detailing the requirements that: 

(A) 
the carrier and signers must be owners of property or registered voters; 

(B)

Persons requesting forms may be required to identify themselves as owners of property or registered voters and may be allowed to pick up additional copies to distribute to other owners of property or registered voters. Each person signing a petition must indicate whether the person is signing the petition as a registered voter within the political subdivision or is signing the petition as the owner of property within the political subdivision. A person who signs a petition as a registered voter must indicate the address at which the person is registered to vote. A person who signs a petition as an owner of property must indicate the address of the property owned by the person in the political subdivision.

Each petition must be verified under oath by at least one (1) qualified petitioner in a manner prescribed by the state board of accounts before the petition is filed with the county voter registration office under subdivision (7). 

(7) 
Each petition must be filed with the county voter registration office not more than thirty (30) days after 

publication under subdivision (2) of the notice of the preliminary determination. 

(8) 
The county voter registration office shall determine whether each person who signed the petition is a registered voter. However, after the county voter registration office has determined that at least five hundred twenty-five (525) persons who signed the petition are registered voters within the political subdivision, the county voter registration office is not required to verify whether the remaining persons who signed the petition are registered voters. If the county voter registration office does not determine that at least five hundred twenty-five (525) persons who signed the petition are registered voters, the county voter registration office, not more than fifteen (15) business days after receiving a petition, shall forward a copy of the petition to the county auditor. Not more than ten (10) business days after receiving the copy of the petition, the county auditor shall provide to the county voter registration office a statement verifying: 

(A) 
whether a person who signed the petition as a registered voter but is not a registered voter, as determined by the county voter registration office, is the owner of property in the political subdivision; and

(9) 
The county voter registration office, not more than ten (10) business days after determining that at least five hundred twenty-five (525) persons who signed the petition are registered voters or after receiving the statement from the county auditor under subdivision (8) (as applicable), shall make the final determination of whether a sufficient number of persons have signed the petition. Whenever the name of an individual who signs a petition form as a registered voter contains a minor variation from the name of the registered voter as set forth in the records of the county voter registration office, the signature is presumed to be valid, and there is a presumption that the individual is entitled to sign the petition under this section. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, in determining whether an individual is a registered voter, the county voter registration office shall apply the requirements and procedures used under IC 3 to determine whether a person is a registered voter for purposes of voting in an election governed by IC 3. However, an individual is not required to comply with the provisions concerning providing proof of identification to be considered a registered voter for purposes of this chapter. A person is entitled to sign a petition only one (1) time in a particular referendum process under this chapter, regardless of whether the person owns more than one (1) parcel of real 

property, mobile home assessed as personal property, or manufactured home assessed as personal property or a combination of those types of property within the political subdivision and regardless of whether the person is both a registered voter in the political subdivision and the owner of property within the political subdivision. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if a petition is presented to the county voter registration office within forty-five (45) days before an election, the county voter registration office may defer acting on the petition, and the time requirements under this section for action by the county voter registration office do not begin to run until five (5) days after the date of the election. 

(10)
 The county voter registration office must file a certificate and each petition with: 

(A)

within thirty-five (35) business days of the filing of the petition requesting the referendum process.

(11) If a sufficient petition requesting the local public question process is not filed by owners of property or registered voters as set forth in this section, the political subdivision may issue bonds or enter into a lease by following the provisions of law relating to the bonds to be issued or lease to be entered into. 
(c) If the proper officers of a political subdivision make a preliminary determination to issue bonds or enter into a lease, the officers shall provide to the county auditor:

IC 6-1.1-20-3.6 Referendum process for bonds or lease for certain projects 
Sec. 3.6. (a) Except as provided in sections 3.7 and 3.8 of this 
chapter, this section applies only to a controlled project described in 
section 3.5(a) of this chapter. 
(b) 
If a sufficient petition requesting the application of the local public question process has been filed as set forth in section 3.5 of this chapter, a political subdivision may not impose property taxes to 

pay debt service on bonds or lease rentals on a lease for a controlled project unless the political subdivision's proposed debt service or lease rental is approved in an election on a local public question held under this section. 

(c) 
Except as provided in subsection (k), the following question shall be submitted to the eligible voters at the election conducted under this section: 


"Shall ________ (insert the name of the political subdivision) issue bonds or enter into a lease to finance ___________ (insert a brief description of the controlled project), which is estimated to cost not more than _______ (insert the total cost of the project) and is estimated to increase the property tax rate for debt service by ___________ (insert increase in tax rate as determined by the department of local government finance)?". 
The public question must appear on the ballot in the form approved by the county election board. If the political subdivision proposing to issue bonds or enter into a lease is located in more than one (1) county, the county election board of each county shall jointly approve the form of the public question that will appear on the ballot in each county. The form approved by the county election board may differ from the language certified to the county election board by the county auditor. If the county election board approves the language of a public question under this subsection, the county election board shall submit the language to the department of local government finance for review. 
(d) 
The department of local government finance shall review the language of the public question to evaluate whether the description of the controlled project is accurate and is not biased against either a vote in favor of the controlled project or a vote against the controlled project. The department of local government finance may either approve the ballot language as submitted or recommend that the ballot language be modified as necessary to ensure that the description of the controlled project is accurate and is not biased. The department of local government finance shall certify its approval or recommendations to the county auditor and the county election board not more than ten (10) days after the language of the public question is submitted to the department for review. If the department of local government finance recommends a modification to the ballot language, the county election board shall, after reviewing the recommendations of the department of local government finance, submit modified ballot language to the department for the department's approval or recommendation of any additional modifications. The public question may not be certified by the county auditor under subsection (e) unless the department of local government finance has first certified the department's final approval of the ballot language for the public question. 

(e) 
The county auditor shall certify the finally approved public question under IC 3-10-9-3 to the county election board of each 


county in which the political subdivision is located. The certification must occur not later than noon: 
(1) 
seventy-four (74) days before a primary election if the public question is to be placed on the primary or municipal primary election ballot; or 

(2) 
August 1 if the public question is to be placed on the general 


or municipal election ballot. Subject to the certification requirements and deadlines under this subsection and except as provided in subsection (k), the public question shall be placed on the ballot at the next primary election, general election, or municipal election in which all voters of the political subdivision are entitled to vote. However, if a primary election, general election, or municipal election will not be held during the first year in which the public question is eligible to be placed on the ballot under this section and if the political subdivision requests the public question to be placed on the ballot at a special election, the public question shall be placed on the ballot at a special election to be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in May or November of the year. The certification must occur not later than noon seventy-four (74) days before a special election to be held in May (if the special election is to be held in May) or noon on August 1 (if the special election is to be held in November). The fiscal body of the political subdivision that requests the special election shall pay the costs of holding the special election. The county election board shall give notice under IC 5-3-1 of a special election conducted under this subsection. A special election conducted under this subsection is under the direction of the county election board. The county election board shall take all steps necessary to carry out the special election. 
(f) 
The circuit court clerk shall certify the results of the public question to the following: 

(1) 
The county auditor of each county in which the political subdivision is located. 

(2) 
The department of local government finance. 



(g) 
Subject to the requirements of IC 6-1.1-18.5-8, the political subdivision may issue the proposed bonds or enter into the proposed lease rental if a majority of the eligible voters voting on the public question vote in favor of the public question. 

(h) 
If a majority of the eligible voters voting on the public question vote in opposition to the public question, both of the following apply: 

(1) 
The political subdivision may not issue the proposed bonds or enter into the proposed lease rental. 

(2) 
Another public question under this section on the same or a substantially similar project may not be submitted to the voters earlier than three hundred fifty (350) days after the date of the election. 




(i) IC 3, to the extent not inconsistent with this section, applies to an election held under this section. 
(j) 
A political subdivision may not artificially divide a capital project into multiple capital projects in order to avoid the requirements of this section and section 3.5 of this chapter. A person that owns property within a political subdivision or a person that is a registered voter residing within a political subdivision may file a petition with the department of local government finance objecting that the political subdivision has artificially divided a capital project into multiple capital projects in order to avoid the requirements of this section and section 3.5 of this chapter. The petition must be filed not more than ten (10) days after the political subdivision makes the preliminary determination to issue the bonds or enter into the lease for the project. If the department of local government finance receives a petition under this subsection, the department shall not later than thirty (30) days after receiving the petition make a final determination on the issue of whether the capital projects were artificially divided. 

(k)
 This subsection applies to a political subdivision for which a petition requesting a public question has been submitted under section 3.5 of this chapter. The legislative body (as defined in IC 36-1-2-9) of the political subdivision may adopt a resolution to withdraw a controlled project from consideration in a public question. If the legislative body provides a certified copy of the resolution to the county auditor and the county election board not later than sixty-three (63) days before the election at which the public question would be on the ballot, the public question on the controlled project shall not be placed on the ballot and the public question on the controlled project shall not be held, regardless of whether the county auditor has certified the public question to the county election board. If the withdrawal of a public question under this subsection requires the county election board to reprint ballots, the political subdivision withdrawing the public question shall pay the costs of reprinting the ballots. If a political subdivision withdraws a public question under this subsection that would have been held at a special election and the county election board has printed the ballots before the legislative body of the political subdivision provides a certified copy of the withdrawal resolution to the county auditor and the county election board, the political subdivision withdrawing the public question shall pay the costs incurred by the county in printing the ballots. If a public question on a controlled project is withdrawn under this subsection, a public question under this section on the same controlled project or a substantially similar controlled project may not be submitted to the voters earlier than three hundred fifty (350) days after the date the resolution withdrawing the public question is adopted. 

(l) 
If a public question regarding a controlled project is placed on the ballot to be voted on at an election under this section, the political subdivision shall submit to the department of local 


government finance, at least thirty (30) days before the election, the following information regarding the proposed controlled project for posting on the department's Internet web site:

(1) 
a sufficient petition requesting the application of the local public question process under section 3.6 of this chapter has not been filed as set forth in section 3.5 of this chapter (in the case of bonds or a lease described in subsection (a)(1)); or 

(2) 
because of the application of section 1.1(6) of this chapter, the bonds or lease is not considered to be issued or entered into for a controlled project (in the case of bonds or a lease described in subsection (a)(2)). 


(c) The following apply to the adoption of a resolution by the fiscal body of a political subdivision under subsection (b):

the fiscal body must adopt the resolution not more than thirty 
(30) 
days after the county voter registration office makes the final determination under section 3.5 of this chapter that a sufficient number of persons have not signed the petition. 

(3) 
In the case of bonds or a lease described in subsection (a)(2), the fiscal body must adopt the resolution not more than thirty (30) days after publication of the notice of the preliminary determination to issue the bonds or enter into the lease. 

(4)
