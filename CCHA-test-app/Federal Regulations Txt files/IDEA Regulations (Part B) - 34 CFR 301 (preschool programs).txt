Example 1 of paragraph 1 the LEA had received from the Federal FY–2 appropriation,
a section 611(g) subgrant that was $20,000
greater than the subgrant it received from
the Federal FY–1 appropriation, then up to
$4,000 of that subgrant could be treated as
local funds. The LEA, however, would have
to spend at least $4,000 of its Federal FY–2
section 611(g) subgrant during its FY–2 in
order for those funds to count as part of its
local expenditures for that year for purposes
of § 300.231.
In this example, if the LEA had carried
over all of its Federal FY–2 section 611(g)
subgrant to the LEA’s FY–3 (and thus did
not spend any of those funds during its FY–
2), then none of the section 611(g) subgrant
funds subject to the 20 percent rule could be
considered as local funds for purposes of determining compliance with § 300.231. (The
reason for this is that auditors, in determining an LEA’s compliance with § 300.231,
examine State and local, or local funds the
LEA actually spent on special education and
related services, and not those funds that the
LEA could, but did not, spend for those purposes.)
If the LEA, in its FY–2, spent $4,000 of its
Federal FY–2 section 611(g) subgrant, then
the LEA could count those expenditures and
bring itself into compliance with § 300.231
(i.e., $996,000 of the LEA’s own local funds
spent on special education and related services plus the $4,000 of Federal FY–2 section
611(g) funds that can be counted as local
funds equals a total of $1,000,000 of local expenditures on special education in its FY–2—
the amount of local expenditures needed to
comply with § 300.231). However, if the LEA
elected to take this step, it could not count
any of the Federal FY–2 section 611(g)
subgrant funds that it will spend in its FY–
3 as local funds.
If the LEA, in its FY–2, spent only $3,000 of
its Federal FY–2 section 611(g) subgrant
funds, then those funds could be counted by
the LEA as local funds in calculating its
compliance with § 300.231 for its FY–2. If the
remaining $1,000 of Federal FY–2 funds available to be considered local funds were spent
in the LEA’s FY–3, those funds could be considered in determining the LEA’s compliance
with § 300.231 for its FY–3. (Note, However,
that if in its FY–2 the LEA had only spent
$996,000 of local funds and $3,000 of its Federal funds, it would not have met the requirements of § 300.231. In this case the auditor would have $1,000 of questioned costs
($1,000,000 ¥ [$996,000 + $3,000] = $1,000) for
FY–2).

(a) Base payments. The State shall
first award each agency described in
§ 301.30 the amount that agency would
have received under section 619 of the
Act for fiscal year 1997 if the State had
distributed 75 percent of its grant for
that year under section 619(c)(3), as
then in effect.
(b) Base payment adjustments. For fiscal year 1998 and beyond—
(1) If a new LEA is created, the State
shall divide the base allocation determined under paragraph (a) of this section for the LEAs that would have been
responsible for serving children with
disabilities now being served by the
new LEA, among the new LEA and affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3
through 5 currently provided special
education by each of the LEAs;
(2) If one or more LEAs are combined
into a single new LEA, the State shall
combine the base allocations of the
merged LEAs; and
(3) If for two or more LEAs, geographic boundaries or administrative
responsibility for providing services to
children with disabilities ages 3
through 5 changes, the base allocations
of affected LEAs shall be redistributed
among affected LEAs based on the relative numbers of children with disabilities ages 3 through 5 currently provided special education by each affected LEA.
(c) Allocation of remaining funds. After
making allocations under paragraph (a)
of this section, the State shall—
(1) Allocate 85 percent of any remaining funds to those agencies on the basis
of the relative numbers of children enrolled in public and private elementary
and secondary schools within the agency’s jurisdiction; and
(2) Allocate 15 percent of those remaining funds to those agencies in accordance with their relative numbers
of children living in poverty, as determined by the SEA.
(3) For the purpose of making grants
under this section, States must apply
on a uniform basis across all LEAs the
best data that are available to them on
the numbers of children enrolled in
public and private elementary and sec-

Pt. 303

ondary schools and the numbers of
children living in poverty.
(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1419(g)(1))

§ 301.32 Reallocation of local education agency funds.
(a) If a SEA determines that an LEA
is adequately providing a free appropriate public education to all children
with disabilities aged 3 through 5 residing in the area served by that agency
with State and local funds, the SEA
may reallocate any portion of the
funds under section 619 of the Act that
are not needed by that local agency to
provide a free appropriate public education to other local educational agencies in the State that are not adequately providing special education
and related services to all children
with disabilities aged 3 through 5 residing in the areas they serve.
(b) If a State provides services to preschool children with disabilities because some or all LEAs and ESAs are
unable or unwilling to provide appropriate programs, the SEA may use payments that would have been available
to those LEAs or ESAs to provide special education and related services to
children with disabilities aged 3
through 5 years, and to two-year-old
children with disabilities receiving
services consistent with § 301.1 who are
residing in the area served by those
LEAs and ESAs.
