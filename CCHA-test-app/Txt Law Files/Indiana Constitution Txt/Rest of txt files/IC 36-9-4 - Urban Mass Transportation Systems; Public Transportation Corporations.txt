IC 36-9-4-13.5 Public transportation corporations in certain counties; city in county having second largest population 
Sec. 13.5. (a) This section applies to a county having a population of more than two hundred fifty thousand (250,000) but less than two hundred seventy thousand (270,000). 
(b) 
The taxing district of a public transportation corporation under this section includes all the territory inside the corporate boundaries of the two (2) cities in the county having the largest populations and such suburban territory as provided in section 13 of this chapter.

This section applies upon the adoption of substantially identical ordinances approving subsection (b) by both: 

(1) 
the public transportation corporation incorporating the additional territory; and 

(2) 
the legislative body of the city being added to the taxing district of the public transportation corporation. 



(d) 
Whenever the city in the county having the second largest population becomes a part of the public transportation corporation, then two (2) additional directors representing that city shall be appointed to the board of directors of the corporation. The directors must be residents of that city and are entitled to all of the rights, privileges, powers, and duties of directors under this chapter. The executive and the legislative body of that city shall each appoint one 

(1) 
director. These two (2) directors must not be of the same political party. The director appointed by the legislative body shall serve for a term of one (1) year, and the director appointed by the executive shall serve for a term of two (2) years. Upon the expiration of the respective terms, successors shall be appointed in accordance with section 18 of this chapter. 

(e)
 If the city in the county having the second largest population appropriates money to support the public transportation corporation in a particular year, and if the territory of that city subsequently becomes a part of the taxing district of the public transportation corporation in that year and is subject to a separate property tax levy for transportation services, the maximum permissible levy of that city for the year following the particular year used to compute the property tax levy limit under IC 6-1.1-18.5 is decreased, and the maximum permissible levy of the public transportation corporation for the particular year used to compute the property tax levy limit 

under IC 6-1.1-18.5 is increased, by an amount equivalent to the current contract amount to be paid by that city to the public transportation corporation for transportation services provided to that city in the particular year. 

(f) 
The public transportation corporation shall establish a single property tax rate applicable to the taxing district of the public transportation corporation, including the territory of the city in the county having the second largest population that is included in the public transportation corporation under this section. The initial permissible levy to be raised by this rate equals the sum of the amount raised by the levy of the public transportation corporation in the previous taxable year plus an amount equivalent to the current contract amount to be paid in the calendar year 1982 by the city in the county having the second largest population to the public transportation corporation. The permissible levy for the subsequent years shall be computed in accordance with IC 6-1.1-18.5. 


(g) If the city in the county having the second largest population is excluded from the public transportation corporation in a subsequent year, and that city is no longer subject to a separate property tax levy for transportation services, the maximum permissible levy of the public transportation corporation for that subsequent year used to compute the property tax levy limit under IC 6-1.1-18.5 is decreased, and the maximum permissible levy of that city for that subsequent year used to compute the property tax levy limit under IC 6-1.1-18.5 is increased, by the amount of the product of the public transportation property tax rate for that subsequent year multiplied by the assessed value in that subsequent year of all taxable property in that city that is excluded from the public transportation corporation.

IC 36-9-4-58 Regulation of department of state revenue; fares; operating expenses 
Sec. 58. (a) An urban mass transportation system operating under this chapter is considered a common carrier not operating under a franchise or contract granted by a municipality and not regulated by ordinance, and is subject to the authority of the department of state revenue under IC 8-2.1 to the same extent as any other common carrier. However, in determining the reasonableness of the fares and charges of such a system, the department of state revenue shall consider, among other factors, the policy of this chapter to foster and assure the development and maintenance of urban mass transportation systems, and it is not necessary that the operating revenues of the system be sufficient to cover the cost to the system of providing adequate service. 
(b) If a public transportation corporation providing public transportation services in Marion County expands its service through a public transportation project authorized and funded under IC 8-25, the public transportation corporation shall establish fares and charges that cover at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the operating expenses of the urban mass transportation system operated by the public transportation corporation. For purposes of this subsection, operating expenses include only those expenses incurred in the operation of fixed route services that are established or expanded as a result of a public transportation project authorized and funded under IC 8-25. The public transportation corporation annually shall report on the corporation's compliance with this subsection not later than sixty (60) days after the close of the corporation's fiscal year. The report must include information on any fare increases necessary to achieve compliance. The public transportation corporation shall submit the report to the department of local government finance and make the report available electronically through the Indiana transparency Internet web site established under IC 5-14-3.8. 
(c) If a public transportation corporation fails to prepare and disclose the annual report in the manner required by subsection (b), any person subject to a tax described in IC 8-25 may initiate a cause of action in the circuit court of the eligible county to compel the appropriate officials of the public transportation corporation to prepare and disclose the annual report not later than thirty (30) days after a court order mandating the public transportation corporation to comply with subsection (b) is issued by the circuit court.
