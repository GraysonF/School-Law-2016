511 IAC 6.2-4-3 Core principles of professional development 
Authority: IC 20-19-2-11 
Affected: IC 20-31-5 

Sec. 3. The following are core principles of professional development: 
(1) 
Professional development programs will address issues that are relevant to the priorities of education improvement and reflect the knowledge base of the profession by doing the following: 

(A) 
Reflecting research-based approaches to effective adult learning, student learning, and organizational change to support ongoing developmental activities. While tapping educators' life experiences and drawing on the knowledge base from effective research, a variety of modes of learning are used to foster self-directed professional development opportunities. 

(B) 
Integrating education improvement priorities. Consistent and continuous links are made with the school improvement plan, the Indiana professional standards board, and the Indiana state board of education policy. 

(C) 
Incorporating both discipline-specific and interdisciplinary approaches to teaching, assessment, and preparation for the world of work. Professional growth experiences enhance educators' knowledge within and across subject areas and their ability to foster and assess students' problem solving and critical thinking skills. 

(D) 
Including explicit strategies for setting high expectations and meeting the diverse learning needs of all students. Training activities increase educators' capacity to implement developmentally-appropriate practices to establish challenging learning goals and respond to the uniqueness of each student. 

(E) 
Receiving adequate resources. Every public school in Indiana must receive the financial resources and support services needed to provide the most effective professional development program, as described within these principles. 



(2) 
Professional development program will engage educators in an effective learning process that impacts practice by doing the following: 

(A) 
Actively involving participants in program design, delivery, and implementation. Professional growth opportunities reflect educators' needs as determined from multiple data sources grounded in and linked with the school improvementplan.Allstakeholders shall beengagedin meaningfuljob-embeddedopportunitiestoeffectivelysupport practice that lead to improved student learning. 

(B) 
Promoting multiple strategies that model recommended strategies. Opportunities for professional development incorporate varied approaches, such as theory, demonstration, reflection, practice, mentoring, technologyapplications, and peer dialogue and coaching. 

(C) 
Incorporating follow-up activities that are sustained over time and provide educators with ongoing feedback. The professional development program provides a range of opportunities for staff to integrate the new strategies into their work with children through practice, feedback, and reflection. 

(D) 
Continuously evaluating impact on educators' practice and student learning. The effectiveness of professional development is determined by its impact on staff performance and student learning. 



(3) 
Professional development programs will contribute to developing an environment that support educators' professional growth by doing the following: 

(A) 
Fostering collegiality and collaboration. Professional growth opportunities encourage staff to build a community of educators, parents, business, and community partners who exchange ideas for innovation, cooperate in developing curricula, and discuss approaches to strengthening student learning by focusing on the school community as a culture of inquiry. 

(B) 
Building capacity through a continuum of ongoing improvement activities. Professional development activities maintain a focus on the improvement of practices that increase student learning and link to the school improvement plan and thestandards developedbytheIndianaprofessionalstandards board and theIndiana stateboard ofeducation policy. 

(C) 
Integrating staff development into educators' practice. The professional development program incorporates supports for staff to implement newly acquired strategies and assess them for their impact on student learning. 

(D) 
Encouraging innovation and risk-taking. As a result of staff development activities, the school community recognizes the need for action research which assists educators, leading toward innovations improving student learning.

not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of each group of students described in section 6 of this rule who are enrolled in the school are required to take state assessments in English and not less than ninety-five percent (95%) of each group of students described in section 6 of this rule who are enrolled in the school are required to take state assessments in mathematics, including an alternate: 

(A) assessment for students with disabilities; and

If, however, the school or school corporation meets the annual objective in English for all student groups in the second year, then the timeline restarts. If the school or school corporation fails to meet the annual objective in mathematics, it has now failed to make adequate yearly progress for one (1) year. If the school or school corporation meets the annual objective in mathematics, the school or school corporation has no consecutive years of not making adequate yearly progress.

If the college and career readiness participation rate is greater than or equal to ninety-five percent (95%), then the participation rate shall be one (1). 

(D) 
If the college and career readiness participation rate is less than ninety-five percent (95%), then the participation rate shall equal the participation rate in decimal form. 

(E) 
If no college and career readiness participation rate data is available then the college and career readiness indictor [sic] shall equal the college and career readiness achievement score.

A school must have four (4) year graduation rate points available to receive a five (5) year graduation score as follows: 

(A) 
A school must have at least ten (10) students in the most recently finalized graduation cohort to obtain a five (5) year graduation rate score.
