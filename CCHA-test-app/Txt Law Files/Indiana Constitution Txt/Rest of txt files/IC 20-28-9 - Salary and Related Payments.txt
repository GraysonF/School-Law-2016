IC 20-28-9-1.5 Teacher's minimum salary; basis; supplemental payments 
Sec. 1.5. (a) This subsection governs salary increases for a teacher employed by a school corporation. Compensation attributable to additional degrees or graduate credits earned before the effective date of a local compensation plan created under this chapter before July 1, 2015, shall continue for school years beginning after June 30, 2015. Compensation attributable to additional degrees for which a teacher has started course work before July 1, 2011, and completed course work before September 2, 2014, shall also continue for school years beginning after June 30, 2015. For school years beginning after June 30, 2015, a school corporation may provide a supplemental payment to a teacher in excess of the salary specified in the school corporation's compensation plan if the teacher teaches an advanced placement course or has earned a master's degree from an accredited postsecondary educational institution in a content area directly related to the subject matter of: 
(1) a dual credit course; or 
(2) 
another course; taught by the teacher. In addition, a supplemental payment may be made to an elementary school teacher who earns a master's degree in math or reading and literacy. A supplement provided under this subsection is not subject to collective bargaining, but a discussion of the supplement must be held. Such a supplement is in addition to any increase permitted under subsection (b). 

(b) 
Increases or increments in a local salary range must be based upon a combination of the following factors: 

(1) 
A combination of the following factors taken together may account for not more than thirty-three percent (33%) of the calculation used to determine a teacher's increase or increment: 

(A) 
The number of years of a teacher's experience. 

(B) 
The attainment of either: 


(i) 
additional content area degrees beyond the requirements for employment; or 

(ii) 
additional content area degrees and credit hours beyond the requirements for employment, if required under an agreement bargained under IC 20-29. 



(2) 
The results of an evaluation conducted under IC 20-28-11.5. 

(3)

(c) 
Except as provided in subsection (d), a teacher rated ineffective or improvement necessary under IC 20-28-11.5 may not receive any raise or increment for the following year if the teacher's employment contract is continued. The amount that would otherwise have been allocated for the salary increase of teachers rated ineffective or improvement necessary shall be allocated for compensation of all teachers rated effective and highly effective based on the criteria in subsection (b). 

(d) 
Subsection (c) does not apply to a teacher in the first two (2) full school years that the teacher provides instruction to students in elementary school or high school. If a teacher provides instruction to students in elementary school or high school in another state, any full school year, or its equivalent in the other state, that the teacher provides instruction counts toward the two (2) full school years under this subsection. 

(e) 
A teacher who does not receive a raise or increment under subsection (c) may file a request with the superintendent or superintendent's designee not later than five (5) days after receiving notice that the teacher received a rating of ineffective. The teacher is entitled to a private conference with the superintendent or superintendent's designee. 

(f) 
The department shall publish a model compensation plan with a model salary range that a school corporation may adopt. Before July 1, 2015, the department may modify the model compensation plan, as needed, to comply with subsection (g). 

(g)

For a school year beginning after June 30, 2015, a local compensation plan must specify the range for teacher salaries. The department shall publish the local compensation plans on the department's Internet web site. 

(h) 
The department shall report any noncompliance with this section to the state board. 

(i) 
The state board shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with this section. 

(j) 
This chapter may not be construed to require or allow a school corporation to decrease the salary of any teacher below the salary the teacher was earning on or before July 1, 2015, if that decrease would be made solely to conform to the new compensation plan.
