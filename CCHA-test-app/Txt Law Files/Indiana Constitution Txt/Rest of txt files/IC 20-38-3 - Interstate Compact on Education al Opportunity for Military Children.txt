IC 20-38-3-12 Rulemaking functions of commission 
Sec. 12. ARTICLE XII. RULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION 
A. The interstate commission shall adopt reasonable rules to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact.

C. Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is adopted, a person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule. However, the filing of a petition does not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless a court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall defer to the actions of the interstate commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the interstate commission's authority. 
D. If a majority of the legislatures of the member states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, the rule has no further force and effect in any compacting state. As added by P.L.21-2009, SEC.1.

A. Oversight 
1. 
The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.

All courts shall take judicial notice of this compact and the rules adopted under this compact in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the interstate commission. 

3. 
The interstate commission is entitled to receive all service of process in any proceeding and has standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the interstate commission renders a judgment or an order void as to the interstate commission, this compact, or adopted rules. 


B. If the interstate commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws, or the adopted rules, the interstate commission shall do the following: 
1. 
Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the interstate commission. The interstate commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default. 

2. 
Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default. 

3. 
If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be withdrawn from this compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact are terminated from the effective date of the defaulting state's withdrawal. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of 

the default. 

4. 
Suspension or termination of membership in this compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or withdraw shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states. 

5. 
The member state that has been suspended or withdrawn is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of its suspension or termination, including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of suspension or withdrawal. 

6. 
The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to any member state that has been found to be in default or that has been suspended or withdrawn from this compact unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the interstate commission and the defaulting member state. 

7. 
The defaulting member state may appeal the action of the interstate commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the interstate commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.
